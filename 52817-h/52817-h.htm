<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>Romances innumerable have been woven around the flaming
guardians of the coast, but it is doubtful whether any purely
imaginative work is so fascinating and absorbing as the plain
unvarnished narrative of how some famous lightship or
lighthouse has been brought into existence. And the story
of construction is equalled in every way by that relating to
the operation and maintenance of the light, against all odds,
for the guidance of those who have business upon the ocean.</p>

<p>This volume is not a history of lightships and lighthouses;
neither is it a technical treatise. Rather my object has been
to relate how the difficulties, peculiar and prodigious, have
been overcome by the builders in their efforts to mark some
terrible danger-spots, both on the mainland and isolated
sea-rocks.</p>

<p>While the lines of the lightship and lighthouse are familiar
to all, popular knowledge concerning the internal apparatus
of the building or ship is somewhat hazy. Therefore I have
explained, with technicalities simplified as much as possible,
the equipment of the tower and vessel, and the methods
whereby both visual and audible warnings are given. The
very latest developments in this field of engineering and
science are incorporated, so as to render the subject as comprehensive
as possible within the limits of a single volume.</p>

<p>In the compilation of this book I have received the
heartiest assistance from those who are prominently associated
with the work of providing adequate aids to navigation,
and am particularly indebted to the engineers to the Commissioners
of Northern Lights, Messrs. D. and C. Stevenson;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Lieutenant-Colonel William P. Anderson, the Engineer-in-Chief
to the Lighthouse Department of the Canadian
Government; the various officials of the Lighthouse Board
of the United States of America; the Engineer-in-Chief to
the French Service des Phares; the lighthouse authorities of
New South Wales and New Zealand; Mr. Gustaf Dalén and
his assistants; Messrs. Chance Brothers and Company,
Limited, of Birmingham; Messrs. Edmondsons, Limited, of
Dublin; Samuel Strain, Esq., the Director of the Lighthouse
Literature Mission, Belfast; the <cite>Scientific American</cite>, and the

<span class="subhead">THE ORIGIN OF THE LIGHTHOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The mariner, in pursuit of his daily business, is exposed to
dangers innumerable. In mid-ocean, for the most part, he
need not fear them particularly, because he has plenty of
sea-room in which to navigate his ship, and in case of thick
fog he can ease up until this dreaded enemy lifts or disperses.
But in crowded coastal waters his position is often precarious,
for he may be menaced by lurking shoals or hidden
reefs, which betray little or no indication of their whereabouts,
and which may be crossed with apparent safety.
If the ship blunders on in ignorance, it is brought up with
a thud as it buries its nose in the sucking sand, or gives
a mighty shiver as it scrapes over the rocky teeth, perhaps
to be clasped as in a vice, or to be battered and broken
so fearfully that, when at last it tears itself free and slips
off into deep water, it can only founder immediately. Here,
if fog blots out the scene, the ship is in danger of being
lured to certain destruction by currents and other natural
forces, since the captain is condemned to a helplessness as
complete as of a blind man in a busy street.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that the captain, as he approaches
or wanders along a tortuous shoreline, scans the
waters eagerly for a glimpse of the guardian monitor, which,
as he knows from his reckonings and chart, should come
within sight to guide him on his way. The danger-signal
may be one of many kinds&mdash;a misty, star-like glimmer
thrown from a buoy dancing on the waves, the radiant orb
from a lightship bobbing up and down and swinging rhythmically
to and fro, a fixed flare-light, or dazzling, spoke-like
rays revolving across the sky. If sight be impossible
owing to fog, he must depend upon his ear for the measured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
tolling of a bell, the shriek of a whistle, the deep blare of a
siren, or the sharp report of an explosive. When he has
picked up one or other of these warnings, he feels more at
ease, and proceeds upon his way, eyes and ears keenly
strained for warning of the next danger ahead.</p>

<p>The lighthouse is the greatest blessing that has been
bestowed upon navigation. It renders advance through
the waters at night as safe and as simple as in the brilliancy
of the midday sun. But for these beacons the safe movement
of ships at night or during fog along the crowded
steamship highways which surround the serrated shores of
the five continents would be impossible. It is only natural,
therefore, that the various nations of the world should strenuously
endeavour to light their coasts so adequately that the
ship may proceed at night as safely and as comfortably as a
man may walk down an illuminated city thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Whence came the idea of lighting the coastline with
flaring beacons? It is impossible to say. They have
been handed down to modern civilization through the mists
of time. The first authentic lighthouse was Sigeum, on
the Hellespont, which undoubtedly antedates the famous
Pharos of Alexandria. The latter was a massive square
tower, 400 feet high, and was known as one of the Seven
Wonders of the World. It was built about 331 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The
warning light was emitted from a huge wood fire, which
was kept burning at the summit continuously during the
night; the illumination is stated to have been visible for
a distance of forty miles, but modern knowledge disputes
this range. The precise design of this wonderful tower is
unknown, but it must have been a huge structure, inasmuch
as it is computed to have cost the equivalent in modern
money of over £200,000, or $1,000,000.</p>

<p>For sixteen hundred years it guided the navigators among
the waters from which it reared its smoking crest, and then
it disappeared. How, no one knows, although it is surmised
that it was razed by an earthquake; but, although it was
swept from sight, its memory has been preserved, and the
French, Italian, and Spanish nations use its name in connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
with the lighthouse, which in France is called
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">phare</i>; in the other two countries mentioned, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">faro</i>.</p>

<p>The Romans in their conquest of Gaul and Britain
brought the lighthouse with them, and several remains of
their efforts in this direction are to be found in England,
notably the pharos at Dover.</p>

<p>In all probability, however, the lighthouse in its most
primitive form is at least as old as the earliest books of the
Bible. Undoubtedly it sprang from the practice of guiding
the incoming boatman to his home by means of a blazing
bonfire set up in a conspicuous position near by. Such a
guide is a perfectly obvious device, which even to-day is
practised by certain savage tribes.</p>

<p>When the Phœnicians traded in tin with the ancient
Britons of Cornwall, their boats continually traversed the
rough waters washing the western coasts of Spain, where,
for the safer passage of their sailors, doubtless, they erected
beacons upon prominent headlands. The oldest lighthouse
in the world to-day, which in some quarters is held to be
of Phœnician origin, is that at Corunna, a few miles north
of Cape Finisterre. Other authorities maintain that it was
built during the reign of the Roman Emperor Trajan. In
1634 it was reconstructed, and is still in existence.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Gironde is another highly interesting
link with past efforts and triumphs in lighthouse engineering.
The Gironde River empties itself into the Bay of
Biscay through a wide estuary, in the centre of which is
a bunch of rocks offering a terrible menace to vessels.
This situation achieved an unenviable reputation in the
days when ships first ventured out to sea. Being exposed
to the broad Atlantic, it receives the full force of the gales
which rage in the Bay of Biscay, and which make of the
Gironde River estuary a fearful trap. The trading town of
Bordeaux suffered severely from the ill fame attached to
the mouth of the waterway upon which it was dependent,
for both the sea and the roads exacted a heavy toll among
the ships which traded with the famous wine capital of
Gascony. How many fine vessels struck the rocks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Cordouan and went to pieces within sight of land, history
does not record, but the casualties became so numerous
that at last the firms trading with Bordeaux refused to
venture into the Gironde unless a light were placed on the
reef to guide their captains. Alarmed at the prospect of
losing their remunerative traffic, the citizens of Bordeaux
built a tower upon the deadly reef, with a beacon which they
kept stoked with wood, four men being reserved for its
service. In return the authorities exacted a tax from each
vessel arriving and leaving the port, in order to defray the
expense thus incurred. Probably from this action originated
the custom of lighthouse dues.</p>

<p>This bonfire served its purposes until the Black Prince
brought Gascony under his power. He demolished the
primitive beacon, and erected in its place another tower,
40 feet high, on which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chauffer</i> was placed, a hermit
being entrusted with the maintenance of the light at night.
Near the lighthouse&mdash;if such it can be called&mdash;a chapel was
built, around which a few fishermen erected their dwellings.
When the hermit died, no one offered to take his place.
The beacon went untended, the fishermen departed, and
the reef once more was allowed to claim its victims from
shipping venturing into the estuary.</p>

<p>In 1584 an eminent French architect, Louis de Foix,
secured the requisite concession to build a new structure.
He evolved the fantastic idea of a single building which
should comprise a beacon, a church and a royal residence
in one. For nearly twenty-seven years he laboured upon
the rock, exposed to the elements, before he (or rather his
successor) was able to throw the welcome warning rays
from the summit of his creation. This was certainly the
most remarkable lighthouse that has ever been set up. It
was richly decorated and artistically embellished, and the
tower was in reality a series of galleries rising tier upon tier.
At the base was a circular stone platform, 134 feet in
diameter, flanked by an elegant parapet surrounding the
light-keepers’ abode. This lower structure was intended
to form a kind of breakwater which should protect the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
main building from the force of the waves. On the first
floor was a magnificent entrance hall, leading to the King’s
apartment, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> finely decorated with pillars and mural
sculptures. Above was a beautiful chapel with a lofty roof
supported by carved Corinthian columns. Finally came
the beacon, which at that date was about 100 feet above
the sea-level.</p>

<p>Access to the successive floors was provided by a beautiful
spiral staircase, the newels of which were flanked by busts
of the two French Kings, Henry III. and Henry IV., and of
the designer de Foix. The architect died not long before his
work was completed, but the directions he left behind him
were so explicit that no difficulty was experienced in consummating
his ideas, and the Tour de Cordouan shed its
beneficial light for the first time over the waters of the Bay
of Biscay in 1611. So strongly was the building founded
that it has defied the attacks of Nature to this day, although
it did not escape those of the vandals of the French Revolution,
who penetrated the tower, where the busts of the
two Henrys at once excited their passion. The symbols
of monarchy were promptly hurled to the floor, and other
damage was inflicted. When order was restored, the busts
were replaced, and all the carvings which had suffered
mutilation from mob law were restored. At the same time,
in accordance with the spirit of progress, the tower was
modified to bring it into line with modern lighting principles;
it was extended to a height of 197 feet, and was crowned
with an up-to-date light, visible twenty-seven miles out to
sea. For more than three centuries it has fulfilled its designed
purpose, and still ranks as the most magnificent
lighthouse that ever has been built. Its cost is not recorded,
but it must necessarily have been enormous.</p>

<p>In Great Britain the seafarer’s warning light followed the
lines of those in vogue upon the older part of the Continent,
consisting chiefly of wood and coal fires mounted on conspicuous
lofty points around the coast. These braziers
were maintained both by public and by private enterprise.
Patents were granted to certain individuals for the upkeep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
of beacons in England and Scotland, and from time to time
the holders of these rights came into conflict with the public
authority which was created subsequently for the maintenance
of various aids to navigation around the coasts. In
England these monopolies were not extinguished until 1836,
when the Brethren of Trinity House were empowered, by
special Act of Parliament, to purchase the lights which
had been provided both by the Crown and by private
interests, so as to bring the control under one corporation.</p>

<p>HOW THE BEACHY HEAD LIGHTHOUSE WAS BUILT.</p>

<p class="captionl">To facilitate erection a cableway was stretched between the top of Beachy Head and a staging placed
beside the site of the tower in the water. A stone is being sent down.</p></div></div>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chauffer</i>, however, was an unsatisfactory as well as
an expensive type of beacon. Some of these grates consumed
as many as 400 tons of coal per annum&mdash;more than
a ton of coal per night&mdash;in addition to vast quantities of
wood. Being completely exposed, they were subject to
the caprices of the wind. When a gale blew off the land,
the light on the sea side was of great relative brilliancy;
but when off the water, the side of the fire facing the sea
would be quite black, whereas on the landward side the
fire bars were almost melting under the fierce heat generated
by the intense draughts. This was the greater drawback,
because it was, of course, precisely when the wind was
making a lee shore below the beacon that the more brilliant
light was required.</p>

<p>When the Pilgrim Fathers made their historic trek to the
United States, they took Old World ideas with them. The
first light provided on the North American continent was
at Point Allerton, the most prominent headland near the
entrance to Boston Harbour, where 400 boatloads of stone
were devoted to the erection of a tower capped with a large
basket of iron in which “fier-bales of pitch and ocum”
were burned. This beacon served the purpose of guiding
navigators into and out of Boston Harbour for several
years.</p>

<p>When, however, the shortcomings of the exposed fire
were realized, attempts were made to evolve a lighting
system, which does in reality constitute the foundation of
modern practice. But the beacon fire held its own for many
years after the new principle came into vogue, the last coal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
fire in England being the Flat Holme Light, in the Bristol
Channel, which was not superseded until 1822.</p>

<p>In Scotland the coal fire survived until 1816, one of the
most important of these beacons being that on the Isle of
May, in the Firth of Forth, which fulfilled its function for
181 years. This was a lofty tower, erected in 1636, on which
a primitive type of pulley was installed for the purpose of
raising the fuel to the level of the brazier, while three men
were deputed to the task of stoking the fire. It was one
of the private erections, and the owner of the Isle of May,
the Duke of Portland, in return for maintaining the light,
was allowed to exact a toll from passing vessels. When
the welfare of the Scottish aids to navigation was placed
under the control of the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses,
this body, realizing the importance of the position,
wished to erect upon the island a commanding lighthouse
illuminated with oil lamps; but it was necessary first to
buy out the owner’s rights, and an Act of Parliament was
passed authorizing this action, together with the purchase
of the island and the right to levy tolls, at an expenditure
of £60,000, or $300,000. In 1816 the coal fire was finally
extinguished.</p>

<p>The English lights are maintained by the Brethren of
Trinity House, and their cost is defrayed by passing
shipping. This corporation received its first charter during
the reign of Henry VIII. Trinity House, as it is called
colloquially, also possesses certain powers over the Commissioners
of Northern Lights and the Commissioners of
Irish Lights, and is itself under the sway, in regard to certain
powers, such as the levy of light dues, of the Board of
Trade. This system of compelling shipowners to maintain
the coast lights is somewhat anomalous; it possesses many
drawbacks, and has provoked quaint situations at times.
Thus, when the <i>Mohegan</i> and the <i>Paris</i> were wrecked on
the Manacles within the space of a few months, the outcry
for better lighting of this part of the Devon and Cornish
coasts was loud and bitter. The shipowners clamoured for
more protection, but at the same time, knowing that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
would have to foot the bill, maintained that further lighting
was unnecessary.</p>

<p>The British Isles might very well emulate the example
of the United States, France, Canada, and other countries,
which regard coast lighting as a work of humanity, for the
benefit of one and all, and so defray the cost out of the
Government revenues. Some years ago, when an International
Conference was held to discuss this question, some
of the representatives suggested that those nations which
give their lighthouse services free to the world should distinguish
against British shipping, and levy light-dues
upon British ships, with a view to compelling the abolition
of the tax upon foreign vessels visiting British ports. Fortunately,
the threat was not carried into execution.</p>

<p>The design and construction of lighthouses have developed
into a highly specialized branch of engineering. Among
the many illustrious names associated with this phase of
enterprise&mdash;de Foix, Rudyerd, Smeaton, Walker, Douglass,
Alexander, and Ribière&mdash;the Stevenson family stands
pre-eminent. Ever since the maintenance of the Scottish
coast lights was handed over to the Northern Commissioners,
the engineering chair has remained in the hands of this
family, the names of whose members are identified with
many lights that have become famous throughout the world
for their daring nature, design, and construction. Moreover,
the family’s contributions to the science of this privileged
craft have been of incalculable value. Robert Louis
Stevenson has written a fascinating story around their
exploits in “A Family of Engineers.”</p>

<p>It was at first intended that the great author himself
should follow in the footsteps of his forbears. He completed
his apprenticeship at the drawing-table under his father
and uncle, and became initiated into the mysteries of the
craft. At the outset he apparently had visions of becoming
numbered among those of his family who had achieved
eminence in lighthouse construction, and he often accompanied
his father or uncle on their periodical rounds of
inspection. Probably the rough and tumble life in a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
tender among the wild seas of Scotland, the excitement of
landing upon dangerous rocks, the aspect of loneliness revealed
by acquaintance with the keepers, and the following
of the growth of a new tower from its foundations, stirred
his imagination, so that the dormant literary instinct, which,
like that of engineering, he had inherited, became fired.
Mathematical formulæ, figures, and drawings, wrestled for
a time with imagination and letters, but the call of the
literary heritage proved triumphant, and, unlike his grandfather,
who combined literature with lighthouse construction,
and who, indeed, was a polished author, as his stirring
story of the “Bell Rock Lighthouse” conclusively shows,
he finally threw in his lot with letters.</p>

<p>The fact that for more than a century one family has
held the exacting position of chief engineer to the Northern
Commissioners, and has been responsible for the lights
around Scotland’s troublous coasts, is unique in the annals
of engineering. Each generation has been identified with
some notable enterprise in this field. Thomas Smith, the
father-in-law of Robert Stevenson, founded the service,
and was the first engineer to the Commissioners. Robert
Stevenson assumed his mantle and produced the “Bell
Rock.” His son, Alan Stevenson, was the creator of the
“Skerryvore.” The next in the chain, David Stevenson,
built the “North Unst.” David and Thomas Stevenson,
who followed, contributed the “Dhu-Heartach” and the
“Chicken Rock” lights; while the present generation,
David and Charles, have erected such works as “Rattray
Briggs,” “Sule Skerry,” and the Flannen Islands lighthouses.
In addition, the latter have developed lighthouse
engineering in many novel directions, such as the unattended
Otter Rock lightship, the unattended Guernsey
lighthouse, and the automatic, acetylene, fog-signal gun,
which are described elsewhere in this volume.</p>

<p>Some forty years ago the Stevensons also drew up the
scheme and designed the first lighthouses for guarding the
coasts of Japan. The essential optical apparatus and other
fittings were built and temporarily erected in England, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
dismantled and shipped to the East, to be set up in their
designed places. The Japanese did not fail to manifest
their characteristic trait in connection with lighthouses as
with other branches of engineering. The structures produced
by the Scottish engineers fulfilled the requirements
so perfectly, and were such excellent models, as to be considered
a first-class foundation for the Japanese lighthouse
service. The native engineers took these lights as their
pattern, and, unaided, extended their coast lighting system
upon the lines laid down by the Stevensons. Since that
date Japan has never gone outside her own borders for assistance
in lighthouse engineering.</p>

<span class="subhead">BUILDING A LIGHTHOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Obviously, the task of erecting a lighthouse varies considerably
with the situation. On the mainland construction
is straightforward, and offers little more difficulty than
the building of a house. The work assumes its most
romantic and fascinating form when it is associated with
a small rocky islet out to sea, such as the Eddystone,
Skerryvore, or Minot’s Ledge; or with a treacherous, exposed
stretch of sand, such as that upon which the Rothersand
light is raised. Under such conditions the operation
is truly herculean, and the ingenuity and resource of the
engineer are taxed to a superlative degree; then he is
pitted against Nature in her most awful guise. Wind and
wave, moreover, are such formidable and relentless antagonists
that for the most momentary failure of vigilance
and care the full penalty is exacted. Then there are the
fiercely scurrying currents, tides, breakers, and surf, against
which battle must be waged, with the odds so overwhelmingly
ranged against frail human endeavour that advance
can only be made by inches. The lighthouse engineer must
possess the patience of a Job, the tenacity of a limpet, a
determination which cannot be measured, and a perseverance
which defies galling delays and repeated rebuffs.
Perils of an extreme character beset him on every hand;
thrilling escape and sensational incident are inseparable
from his calling.</p>

<p>The first step is the survey of the site, the determination of
the character of the rock and of its general configuration,
and the takings of levels and measurements for the foundations.
When the rugged hump is only a few feet in diameter
little latitude is afforded the engineer for selection, but in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
instances where the islet is of appreciable area some little
time may be occupied in deciding just where the structure
shall be placed. It seems a simple enough task to determine;
one capable of solution within a few minutes, and so for
the most part it is&mdash;not from choice, but necessity&mdash;when
once the surface of the rock is gained. The paramount
difficulty is to secure a landing upon the site. The islet is
certain to be the centre of madly surging currents, eddies,
and surf, demanding wary approach in a small boat, while
the search for a suitable point upon which to plant a foot
is invariably perplexing. Somehow, the majority of these
bleak, wave-swept rocks have only one little place where
a landing may be made, and that only at certain infrequent
periods, the discovery of which in the first instance often
taxes the engineer sorely.</p>

<p>Often weeks will be expended in reconnoitring the position,
awaiting a favourable wind and a placid sea. Time to the
surveyor must be no object. He is the sport of the elements,
and he must curb his impatience. To do otherwise
is to court disaster. The actual operations on the rock
may only occupy twenty minutes or so, but the task of
landing is equalled by that of getting off again&mdash;the latter
frequently a more hazardous job than the former.</p>

<p>The west coast of Scotland is dreaded, if such a term may
be used, by the engineer, because the survey inevitably
is associated with bitter disappointments and maddening
delays owing to the caprices of the ocean. This is not
surprising when it is remembered that this coastline is of
a cruel, forbidding character and is exposed to the full
reach of the Atlantic, with its puzzling swell and vicious
currents. The same applies to the west coast of Ireland
and the open parts of the South of England. The Casquets,
off the coast of Alderney, are particularly difficult of approach,
as they are washed on all sides by wild races of
water. There is only one little cove where a landing may
be effected by stepping directly from a boat, and this place
can be approached only in the calmest weather and when
the wind is blowing in a certain direction. On one occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
when I had received permission to visit the lighthouse, I
frittered away three weeks in Alderney awaiting a favourable
opportunity to go out, and then gave up the attempt
in disgust. As it happened, another month elapsed before
the rock was approachable to make the relief.</p>

<p>When the United States Lighthouse Board sanctioned
the construction of the Tillamook lighthouse on the rock
of that name, off the Oregon coast, the engineer in charge
of the survey was compelled to wait six months before he
could venture to approach the island. In this instance,
however, his time was not wasted entirely, as there were
many preparations to be completed on the mainland to
facilitate construction when it should be commenced. Early
in June, 1879, the weather moderated, and the Pacific
assumed an aspect in keeping with its name. Stimulated
by the prospect of carrying out his appointed task, the
engineer pushed off in a boat, but, to his chagrin, when he
drew near the rock he found the prospects of landing to be
hopeless. He cruised about, reconnoitring generally from
the water, and then returned to shore somewhat disgusted.</p>

<p>A fortnight later he was instructed to take up his position
at Astoria, to keep a sharp eye on the weather, to take the
first chance that presented itself of gaining the rock, and
not to return to headquarters until he had made a landing.
He fretted and fumed day after day, and at last pushed off
with a gang of men when the sea where it lapped the beach
of the mainland was as smooth as a lake; but as they
drew near the Tillamook it was the same old story. A
treacherous swell was running, the waves were curling
wickedly and fussily around the islet; but the engineer
had made up his mind that he would be balked no longer,
so the boat was pulled in warily, in the face of terrible risk,
and two sailors were ordered to get ashore by hook or by
crook. The boat swung to and fro in the swell. Time after
time it was carried forward to the landing spot by a wave,
and then, just as the men were ready to jump, the receding
waters would throw it back. At last, as it swung by the
spot, the two men gave a leap and landed safely. The next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
proceeding was to pass instruments ashore, but the swell,
as if incensed at the partial success achieved, grew more
boisterous, and the boat had to back away from the rock.
The men who had landed, and who had not moved a yard
from the spot they had gained, became frightened at this
manœuvre, and, fearing that they might be marooned,
jumped into the sea, and were pulled into the boat by means
of their life-lines, without having accomplished a stroke.</p>

<p>THE SANGANEB REEF LIGHTHOUSE IN THE RED SEA.</p>

<p class="captionl">It indicates a treacherous coral reef, 703 miles from Suez. It is an iron tower 180 feet high,
with a white flashing light having a range of 19 miles.</p></div></div>

<p>The engineer chafed under these disappointments, and
himself determined to incur the risk of landing at all
hazards. With his tape-line in his pocket, he set out once
more a few days later, and in a surf-boat pulled steadily
into the froth and foam around the rock; while the men
sawed to and fro the landing-place, he crouched in the
bow, watching his opportunity. Presently, the boat steadying
itself for a moment, he made a spring and reached the
rock. He could not get his instruments ashore, so without
loss of time he ran his line from point to point as rapidly
as he could, jotted down hurried notes, and, when the swell
was growing restive again, hailed the boat, and at a favourable
moment, as it manœuvred round, jumped into it.</p>

<p>The details he had secured, though hastily prepared,
were sufficient for the purpose. His report was considered
and the character of the beacon decided. There was some
discussion as to the most favourable situation for the light
upon the rock, so a more detailed survey was demanded to
settle this problem. This task was entrusted to an Englishman,
Mr. John R. Trewavas, who was familiar with work
under such conditions. He was a master-mason of Portland
and had been engaged upon the construction of the Wolf
Rock, one of the most notable and difficult works of its kind
in the history of lighthouse engineering.</p>

<p>He pushed off to the rock on September 18, 1879, in a
surf-boat, only to find the usual state of things prevailing.
The boat was run in, and, emulating the first engineer’s feat,
he cleared the water and landed on the steep, rocky slope;
but it was wet and slippery, and his feet played him false.
He stumbled, and stooped to regain his balance, but just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
then a roller curled in, snatched him up and threw him into
the whirlpool of currents. Life-lines were thrown, and the
surf-boat struggled desperately to get near him, but he was
dragged down by the undertow and never seen again.
This fatality scared his companions, who returned hastily
to the mainland. The recital of their dramatic story stirred
the public to such a pitch that the authorities were frantically
urged to abandon the project of lighting the Tillamook.</p>

<p>Mr. David Stevenson related to me an exciting twenty
minutes which befell him and his brother while surveying
a rock off the west coast of Scotland. They had been
waiting patiently for a favourable moment to effect a landing,
and when at last it appeared they drew in and clambered
ashore. But they could not advance another inch. The
rock was jagged and broken, while its surface was as slippery
as ice owing to a thick covering of slimy seaweed whereon
boots could not possibly secure a hold. Having gained the
rock with so much difficulty, they were not going away
empty-handed. As they could not stand in their boots,
they promptly removed them, and, taking their line and
levels, picked their way gingerly over the jagged, slippery
surface in their stockinged feet. Movement certainly was
exceedingly uncomfortable, because their toes displayed
an uncanny readiness to find every needle-point on the
islet; but the wool of their footwear enabled them to obtain
a firm grip upon the treacherous surface, without the risk
of being upset and having a limb battered or broken in the
process. Twenty minutes were spent in making investigations
under these disconcerting conditions, but the time
was adequate to provide all the details required. When
they had completed the survey and had regained their
boat&mdash;a matter of no little difficulty in the circumstances&mdash;their
feet bore sad traces of the ordeal through which they
had passed. However, their one concern was the completion
of the survey; that had been made successfully and was
well worth the toll exacted in the form of physical discomfort.</p>

  </div></div>

<p>As a rule, on a wave-swept rock which only shows itself
at short intervals during the day, the preparation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
foundations is not an exacting task. A little paring with
chisels and dynamite may be requisite here and there, but
invariably the engineer takes the exposed surface as the
basis for his work. The sea has eaten away all the soft,
friable material in its ceaseless erosion, leaving an excellent
foundation to which the superstructure can be keyed to
become as solid as the rock itself.</p>

<p>When the beacon is to be erected upon a sandy bottom,
the engineer’s work becomes more baffling, as he is compelled
to carry his underwater work down to a point where a
stable foundation may be secured. When the Leasowe
lighthouse was built on the sandy Wirral shore, the
builders were puzzled by the lack of a suitable foundation
for the masonry tower. An ingenious way out of the difficulty
was effected. In the vicinity an incoming ship, laden
with a cargo of cotton, had gone ashore and had become a
total wreck. The cotton was useless for its intended purpose,
so the bales were salvaged and dumped into the sand
at the point where the lighthouse was to be erected. The
fleecy mass settled into the sand, and under compression
became as solid as a rock, while its permanency was assured
by its complete submersion. The stability of this strange
foundation may be gathered from the fact that the tower
erected thereon stood, and shed its welcome light regularly
every night, for about a century and a half, only being
extinguished two or three years ago as it was no longer
required.</p>

<p>In the Old World, and, indeed, in the great majority of
instances, the lighthouse is what is described as a “monolithic
structure,” being built of courses of masonry, the
blocks of which are dovetailed together not only laterally,
but also perpendicularly, so that, when completed, the
tower comprises a solid mass with each stone jointed to its
fellow on four or five of its six sides. This method was first
tried in connection with the Hanois lighthouse, off the
Guernsey coast, and was found so successful that it has
been adopted universally in all lighthouses which are exposed
to the action of the waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
The upper face and one end of each block are provided
with projections, while the lower face and the other end
are given indentations. Thus, when the block is set in
position, the projections fit into corresponding indentations
in the adjacent blocks, while the indentations receive the
projections from two other neighbouring pieces. The whole
is locked together by the aid of hydraulic cement. Consequently
the waves, or any other agency, cannot possibly
dislodge a stone without breaking the dovetails or smashing
the stone itself. For the bottom layer, of course, the surface
of the rock is pared away sufficiently to receive the stone,
which is bedded in cement adhering to both the rock and
the superimposed block. A hole is then drilled through the
latter deep into the rock beneath, into which a steel rod or
bolt is driven well home, and the hole is sealed up with
cement forced in under such pressure as to penetrate every
interstice and crevice.</p>

<p>The iron supports constitute the roots, as it were, of the
tower, penetrating deep into the heart of the rock to secure
a firm grip, while the tower itself resembles, in its general
appearance, a symmetrical tree trunk, this form offering
the minimum of resistance to the waves. The lower part
of the tower is made completely solid by the dovetailing of
the integral blocks, and is cylindrical in shape up to a certain
predetermined level which varies according to the surrounding
conditions and the situation of the light. Some years
ago the lighthouse assumed its trunk-like shape at the bottom
course, rising in a graceful concave curve to the lantern;
but this method has been abandoned, inasmuch as, owing
to the decreasing diameter of the tower as it rose course by
course above its foundations, the lowest outer rings of masonry
did not have to withstand any of the superimposed weight,
which naturally bears in a vertical line. By carrying the
lower part to a certain height in the form of a cylinder, and
then commencing the concave curve of the tower, the
pressure of the latter is imposed equally upon the whole of
its foundations. The latter may be stepped&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one tier
of stones may project a little beyond that of the one immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
above&mdash;but this arrangement is adopted in order
to break the smashing force of the waves.</p>

<p>The conditions attending the actual building operations
upon the rock, which may be accessible only for an hour
or two per day in calm weather, prevent the blocks of
granite being shaped and trimmed upon the site. Accordingly,
the lighthouse in the first place is erected piecemeal
on shore. A horizontal course of stones is laid to see
that each dovetail fits tightly and dead true. The next
course is laid upon this, and so on for perhaps eight
or ten courses, the trimming and finicking being accomplished
as the work proceeds. Each projection has to be
only just big enough to enter its relative indentation, while
the latter must be exactly of the requisite dimensions to
receive the projection, and no more. Each stone is then
given an identification mark, so that the masons on the rock
may perceive at a glance its precise position in a course,
and to what ring of stones it belongs. Therefore the mason
at the site has no anxiety about a stone fitting accurately;
he has merely to set it in position upon its bed of cement.</p>

<p>On shore&mdash;generally in the quarry yard&mdash;when a series
of courses have been temporarily built up in this manner
and have received the critical approbation of the resident
engineer, the topmost course is removed and retained, while
the other blocks are despatched to the site. This topmost
course forms the bottom ring in the next section of the
lighthouse which is built up in the yard, and the topmost
course of this section in turn is held to form the bottom
course of the succeeding part of the tower, and so on from
foundation to lantern parapet.</p>

<p>During the past two or three years reinforced concrete
has been employed to a certain extent for lighthouse construction,
but granite of the finest and hardest quality still
remains the material <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i> for towers erected in
exposed, sea-swept positions. The Russian lighthouse
authorities have adopted the ferro-concrete system in regard
to one or two shore lights, especially on the Black Sea,
while another fine structure upon this principle was built<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
by the French <i>Service des Phares</i> in 1905 at the entrance
to the River Gironde. The system has also been adopted
by the Canadian lighthouse authorities; one or two recent
notable lights under their jurisdiction have been constructed
in this material, although on somewhat different lines from
those almost invariably followed, so far as the general design
is concerned.</p>

<p>While the masonry or monolithic structure is the most
durable and substantial structure, it is also the most expensive.
In many parts of the world, notably along the
Atlantic coastline of the United States, what are known as
“screw-pile lighthouses” are used. These buildings vary
in form, some resembling a huge beacon, such as indicates
the entrance to a river, while others convey the impression
of being bungalows or pavilions on stilts. The legs are
stout, cylindrical, iron members, the lower ends of which are
shaped somewhat after the manner of an auger, whereby
they may be screwed into the sea-bed&mdash;hence the name.
This system has been employed for beacons over dangerous
shoals; and while they are somewhat squat, low-lying lights,
they have proved to be highly serviceable.</p>

<p>Iron has been employed also for lighthouse constructional
work, the system in this case being a combination of the
screw pile and the tower, the latter, extending from a platform
whereon the living-quarters are placed and mounted
clear of the water, on piles, being a huge cylindrical pipe
crowned by the lantern. One of the most interesting and
novel of these iron lighthouses is the Hunting Island tower
off the coast of South Carolina. In general design it resembles
the ordinary lighthouse wrought in masonry, and
it is 121½ feet in height from the ground to the focal plane.
It is built of iron throughout, the shell being in the form of
panels, each of which weighs 1,200 pounds.</p>

<p>This type of tower was selected owing to the severe
erosion of the sea at the point where it is placed. When it
was erected in 1875, at a cost of £20,400, or $102,000, it
was planted a quarter of a mile back from the sea. This
action was severely criticized at the time, it being maintained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
that the light was set too far from the water’s edge
to be of practical value; but the hungry ocean disappointed
the critics, because in the course of a few years the intervening
strip of shore disappeared, and the necessity of
demolishing the light and re-erecting it farther inland arose.
On this occasion the engineers determined to postpone a
second removal for some time. The tower was re-erected
at a point one and a quarter miles inland, and the sum of
£10,200, or $51,000, was expended upon the undertaking.
The iron system, which was adopted, proved its value in
this work of removal piece by piece, because, had the tower
been carried out in masonry, it would have been cheaper to
set up a new light, as was done at Cape Henry.</p>

<p>Some of the American coast lights are of the most primitive
and odd-looking character, comprising merely a lofty
skeleton of ironwork. The lamp is a head-light, such as is
carried by railway engines, fitted with a parabolic reflector.
Every morning the lamp is lowered, cleaned, and stored in
a shack at the foot of the pyramid, to be lighted and hauled
into position at dusk. This is the most economical form
of lighthouse which has been devised, the total cost of the
installation being only about £2,500, or $12,500, while the
maintenance charges are equally low. Lights of this description
are employed for the most part in connection with
the lighting of waterways, constituting what is known as
the “back-light” in a range or group of lights studded
along the river to guide the navigator through its twists
and shallows, instead of buoying of the channel.</p>

<p>The task of constructing a sea-rock lighthouse is as tedious
and protracted an enterprise as one could conceive, because
the engineer and his workmen are entirely at the mercy of
the weather. Each great work has bristled with its particular
difficulties; each has presented its individual problems
for solution. Few modern lighthouses, however, have so
baffled the engineer and have occupied such a number of
years in completion, as the Ar-men light off Cape Finisterre.
This tower was commenced in 1867, but so great and so
many were the difficulties involved in its erection that the<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_21">21</a><a  id="Page_22">22</a></span>
light was not first thrown over the Atlantic from its lantern
until 1881.</p>

<p>This light is situated at one of the most dreaded parts
of a sinister coast. At this spot a number of granite points
thrust themselves at times above the water in an indentation
which has received the lugubrious name Bay of the
Dead. The title is well deserved, for it is impossible to
say how many ships have gone down through fouling these
greedy fangs, or how many lives have been lost in its
vicinity. The waters around the spot are a seething race
of currents, eddies, and whirlpools. It is an ocean graveyard
in very truth, and although mariners are only too
cognizant of its terrible character, and endeavour to give
this corner of the European mainland a wide birth, yet
storms and fogs upset the calculations of the most careful
navigators.</p>

<p class="captionc">A typical example of the American iron screw pile system. A vessel ran into this beacon and wrecked it; the ruins caught fire, and the keepers

<p>As the streams of traffic across the Bay of Biscay grew
denser and denser, it became imperative to provide a
guardian light at this spot, and the engineers embarked
upon their task. They knew well that they were faced
with a daring and trying enterprise, and weeks were spent
in these troubled waters seeking for the most favourable
site. As a result of their elaborate surveys, they decided
that the rock of Ar-men offered the only suitable situation;
but what a precarious foundation upon which to lift a massive
masonry tower! The hump is only 25 feet wide by 50 feet
in length; no more than three little pinnacles projected
above the sea-level, and at low-tide less than 5 feet of the
tough gneiss were exposed. Nor was this the most adverse
feature. The rock is in the centre of the bad waters, and
is swept from end to end, under all conditions of weather,
by the furious swell. Some idea of the prospect confronting
the engineers may be gathered from the fact that a whole
year was spent in the effort to make one landing to take
levels.</p>

<p>When construction was taken in hand the outlook was
even more appalling. It was as if the sea recognized that
its day of plunder was to draw to a close. The workmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
were brought, with all materials and appliances, to the
nearest strategical point on the mainland, where a depot
was established. Yet in the course of two years the workmen,
although they strove day after day to land upon the
rock, only succeeded twenty-three times, while during this
period only twenty-six hours’ work was accomplished! It
is not surprising that, when the men did land, they toiled
like Trojans to make the most of the brief interval. The
sum of their work in this time was the planting of the
lighthouse’s roots in the form of fifty-five circular bars,
each 2 inches in diameter and spaced 3¼ feet apart at a
depth of about 12 inches in the granite mass. By the end
of 1870 the cylindrical foundation had crept a few feet above
the highest projection; this plinth was 24 feet in diameter,
18 feet in height, and was solid throughout. A greater
diameter was impossible as the wall was brought almost
to the edge of the rock.</p>

<p>By dint of great effort this part of the work was completed
by the end of 1874, which year, by the way, showed the
greatest advance that had been attained in a single twelvemonth.
As much of the foundations was completed in
this year as had been achieved during the three previous
years. Although the heavy gales pounded the structure
mercilessly, so well was the masonry laid that it offered
quite effective resistance. Upon this plinth was placed the
base of the tower. This likewise is 24 feet in diameter,
and about 10 feet in height. It is also of massive construction,
being solid except for a central cylindrical space
which is capable of receiving some 5 tons of coal.</p>

<p>SETTING THE LAST STONE OF THE BEACHY HEAD LIGHTHOUSE.</p></div></div>

<p>The base was completed in a single year, and in 1876 the
erection of the tower proper was commenced, together with
the completion of the approaching stairway leading from
the water-level to the base of the structure. The latter,
divided into seven stories, rises in the form of a slender
cone, tapering from a diameter of 21½ feet at the bottom
to 16½ feet at the top beneath the lantern. Some idea of
the massive character of the work which was demanded in
order to resist the intense fury of the waves may be realized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
when it is mentioned that the wall at the first and second
floors is 5½ feet in thickness, leaving a diameter of 10 feet
for the apartment on the first floor, which is devoted to the
storage of water, and of 7 feet for that on the second floor,
which contains the oil reservoirs for the lamps. The living-rooms
have a diameter of 11 feet, this increased space being
obtained by reducing the thickness of the wall to 2½ feet.
The erection of the superstructure went forward steadily,
five years being occupied in carrying the masonry from the
base to the lantern gallery, so that in 1881 for the first time
powerful warning was given of a danger dreaded, and often
unavoidable, from the time when ships first sailed these seas.
Fifteen years’ labour and peril on the part of the engineers
and their assistants were crowned with success.</p>

<p>Whereas the Ar-men light off Cape Finisterre demanded
fifteen years for its completion, the construction of the
Beachy Head lighthouse off the South of England coast
was completed within a few months. It is true that the
conditions were vastly dissimilar, but the Sussex shore is
exposed to the full brunt of the south-westerly and south-easterly
gales. This lighthouse thrusts its slender lines
from the water, its foundations being sunk into the chalk
bed of the Channel, 550 feet from the base of the towering
white cliffs, which constitute a striking background. This
beacon was brought into service in 1902, its construction
having occupied about two years. The light formerly was
placed on the crown of the precipice behind, but, being
then some 285 feet above the water, was far from being
satisfactory, as its rays were frequently blotted out by the
ruffle of mist which gathers around Beachy Head on the
approach of evening.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is one of the great objections to placing a
light upon a lofty headland. In such a position it does not
serve as an aid, but more often than not as a danger, to
navigation, owing to the light being invisible at the time
when its assistance is required and sought most urgently.
Consequently lighthouse engineers endeavour to set their
towers at such a level that the light is not raised more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
from 160 to 200 feet above the water. In the case of
Beachy Head, a further reason for a new structure was the
disintegration of the cliff upon which the light stood, under
the terrific poundings of the sea, huge falls of chalk having
occurred from time to time, which imperilled the safety of
the building.</p>

<p>When the new lighthouse was taken in hand, investigation
of the sea-bed revealed an excellent foundation in the
dense hard chalk, and accordingly a hole 10 feet deep was
excavated out of the solid mass to receive the footings of
the building. As the site is submerged to a great depth at
high-tide, the first operation was the erection of a circular
dam carried to a sufficient height to enable the men to toil
within. By this arrangement the working spells were
lengthened considerably, labour only being suspended at
high-tide. When the sea ebbed below the edge of the dam,
the water within was pumped out, leaving a dry clear space
for the workmen. Excavation had to be carried out with
pickaxe and shovel, blasting not being permitted for fear
of shattering and splitting up the mass forming the crust
of the sea-bed.</p>

<p>Beside the site a substantial iron staging was erected,
and from this point to the top of the cliffs behind a Bullivant
cableway was stretched, up and down which the various
requirements were carried, together with the workmen.
This cableway, designed by Mr. W.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;H. Carrington,
M.I.C.E., consulting engineer to Messrs. Bullivant and Co.,
Ltd., facilitated rapid and economical construction very
appreciably. The span was about 600 feet between the
erecting stage and the cliff summit, and there were two
fixed ropes stretched parallel from point to point. One
rope, 6 inches in diameter, had a breaking strain of 120 tons;
the second, 5½ inches thick, had a breaking strain of 100 tons.
At the seaward end the cables were anchored into the solid
chalk. Everything required for the constructional operations
was handled by this carrying system, and when it is
recalled that some of the blocks for the lower courses
weighed from 4½ to 5 tons, it will be recognized that such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
method of handling these ungainly loads, with the care
that was demanded to preserve the edges and faces from
injury, solved an abstruse problem completely.</p>

<p>The base of the tower, the diameter of which is 47 feet,
is solid to a height of 48 feet, except for a central circular
space for storing drinking water. It was designed by Sir
Thomas Matthews, M.I.C.E., the Engineer-in-Chief to the
Trinity Brethren, and is a graceful building, the tower
rising in a curve which is described as a “concave elliptic
frustum.” From the base to the lantern gallery is 123½ feet,
and 3,660 tons of Cornish granite were used in its construction.
The over-all height to the top of the lantern is 153
feet. The building is provided with eight floors, comprising
the living and sleeping quarters for the keepers,
storage of oil, and other necessaries. The light, of the
dioptric order, is of 83,000 candle-power, and the two white
flashes given every fifteen seconds are distinguishable for
a distance of seventeen miles, which is the average range of
modern British lighthouses.</p>

<p>Although the constructional work was frequently interrupted
by rough weather, every advantage was taken of
calm periods. While from the point of daring engineering
it does not compare with many of the other great lights
of the world, yet it certainly ranks as a fine example of the
lighthouse builder’s skill. Owing to the elaborate precautions
observed, the achievement was not marred by a
single fatality, although there were many thrilling moments,
the sole result of which, however, was the loss of tools and
sections of the plant, which in the majority of cases were
recovered when the tide fell. The most serious accident
was a crushed toe, which befell one of the masons when a
stone was being bedded.</p>

<p>Although the lighthouse is subjected to the full fury of
wind and wave, if skilfully erected it will withstand the
ravages of both without creating the slightest apprehensions
in the engineer’s mind. The stones are prepared so carefully
that they fit one another like the proverbial glove,
while the cement fills every nook and cranny. Occasionally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
however, the cement will succumb to the natural disintegrating
forces, and, becoming detached, reveal a point
vulnerable to attack. The air within the interstice becomes
compressed by the surging water, and thereby the fabric is
liable to be shattered. Some years ago one or two of the
lighthouses guarding the Great Lakes of North America
were found to have become weakened from this cause. A
novel remedy was evolved by an ingenious engineer. He
provided each tottering lighthouse with an iron overcoat,
enveloping it from top to bottom. The metal was not laid
directly upon the masonry, but was so placed as to leave about
a quarter of an inch between the inner face of the metal and the
surface of the masonry. Liquid cement was then admitted
under pressure&mdash;“grouting” it is called&mdash;into this annular
space, and penetrating every crack and crevice in the
masonry, and adhering both to the metal and the stonework,
it practically formed another intermediate jacket,
binding the two so firmly together as to make them virtually
one. This novel procedure absolutely restored the menaced
building to its original homogeneity and rigidity, so that it
became as sound as the day on which it was built.</p>

<p>Nowadays, owing to the skill in designing and the workmanship
displayed, one never hears of a modern lighthouse
collapsing. Expense is no object; the engineer does not
endeavour to thwart the elements, but follows a design
wherein the minimum of resistance is offered to them.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LIGHT AND ILLUMINANTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While it is the tower that probably creates the deepest
impression upon the popular mind, owing to the round of
difficulties overcome associated with its erection, yet, after
all, it is the light which is the vital thing to the navigator.
To him symmetry of outline in the tower, the searching
problems that had to be solved before it was planted in a
forbidding spot, the risks that were incurred in its erection&mdash;these
are minor details. His one concern is the light thrown
from the topmost height, warning him to keep off a dangerous
spot and by its characteristic enabling him to determine his
position.</p>

<p>I have described the earliest type of light, the open wood
or coal fire blazing on an eminence. In due course the brazier
gave way to tallow candles. This was an advance, certainly,
but the range of the naked light was extremely limited.
Consequently efforts were made to intensify it and to throw
it in the desired direction. The first step was made with a
reflector placed behind the illuminant, similar to that used
with the cheap wall-lamp so common in village workshops.
This, in its improved form, is known as the “catoptric
system,” the reflector being of parabolic shape, with the
light so disposed that all its rays (both horizontal and
vertical) are reflected in one direction by the aid of a highly
polished surface. While the catoptric system is still used
on some light-vessels, its application to important lighthouses
has fallen into desuetude, as it has been superseded
by vastly improved methods. But the reflector, made
either of silvered glass set in a plaster-of-Paris mould or of
brightly polished metallic surfaces, held the field until the
great invention of Augustin Fresnel, which completely
revolutionized the science of lighthouse optics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p class="captionc">Shows one ray throughout the complete circle.<br />

<p>Fresnel was appointed a member of the French Lighthouse
Commission in 1811, and he realized the shortcomings of the
existing catoptric method only too well. Everyone knows
that when a lamp is lighted the luminous rays are diffused
on every side, horizontally as well as vertically. In lighthouse
operations the beam has to be thrown in a horizontal
line only, while the light which is shed towards the top and
bottom must be diverted, so that the proportion of waste
luminosity may be reduced to the minimum. While the
parabolic reflector achieved this end partially, it was far
from being satisfactory, and Fresnel set to work to condense
the whole of the rays into a horizontal beam. Buffon, a
contemporary investigator, as well as Sir David Brewster,
had suggested that the end might be met by building up a
lens in separate concentric rings, but neither reduced his
theories to practice.</p>

<p>Fresnel invented a very simple system. He took a central
piece of glass, which may be described as a bull’s-eye, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
around this disposed a number of concentric rings of glass.
But these rings projected beyond one another. Each constituted
the edge of a lens which, while its radius differed
from that of its neighbour, owing to its position, yet was of
the same focus in regard to the source of illumination. The
parts were shaped with extreme care and were united in
position by the aid of fish glue, the whole being mounted in
a metal frame. The advantage of the system was apparent
in the first demonstrations. The lenses being comparatively
thin, only one-tenth of the light passing through was absorbed,
whereas in the old parabolic reflectors one-half of the
light was lost.</p>

<p class="captionc">(<i>By permission of Messrs. Chance Bros. and Co., Ltd.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>This revolutionary development was perfected in 1822,
and in the following year it was submitted to its first practical
application on the tower of Cordouan in the Gironde. Several
modifications were made by the inventor for the purpose of
adapting his system to varying conditions. One of the most
important was the disposition of lenses and mirrors above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the optical apparatus for the purpose of collecting and driving
back the rays which were sent out vertically from the illuminant,
so that they might be mingled with the horizontal
beam, thereby reinforcing it. At a later date similar
equiangular prisms were placed below the horizontal beam
so as to catch the light thrown downwards from the luminous
source, the result being that finally none, or very little, of
the light emitted by the illuminant was lost, except by
absorption in the process of bending the rays into the desired
direction.</p>

<div id="ip_31" class="figcenter" style="width: 230px;">
  <img src="images/i_p031.jpg" width="230" height="232" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.&mdash;A Twenty-Four Panel Light, which was introduced
into Certain French Lighthouses.</span></div></div>

<p>In this ingenious manner the circle of light is divided into
sections, called “panels,” each of which comprises its bull’s-eye
and its group of concentric rings and prisms. The
extent of this division varies appreciably, as many as
sixteen panels being utilized in some instances. In this
direction, however, subdivision can be carried too far.
Thus, in some of the French lighthouses no less than twenty-four
panels were introduced. The disadvantage is obvious.
The total volume of light emitted from the luminous source
has to be divided into twenty-four parts, one for each panel.
But the fewer the panels, the more light is thrown through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
each, and the correspondingly greater power of the beam.
Thus, in a four-panel light each beam will be six times as
powerful as that thrown from a twenty-four panel apparatus
of the same type.</p>

<p>Fresnel also introduced the system of revolving the
optical apparatus, and by the introduction of suitable devices
was able to give the light a flashing characteristic, so that
it became possible to provide a means of identifying a light
from a distance entirely by the peculiarity of its flash. The
French authorities were so impressed with the wonderful
improvement produced by Fresnel’s epoch-making invention
that it was adopted immediately for all French lights. Great
Britain followed suit a few years later, while other countries
embraced the system subsequently, so that the Fresnel lens
eventually came into universal use.</p>

<p class="captionl">The ray thrown through each panel is six times as powerful as the

<p>But the Frenchman’s ingenious invention has been developed
out of recognition. To-day only the fundamental
basis is retained. Marked improvements were made by Mr.
Alan Stevenson, the famous Scottish lighthouse engineer.
In fact, he carried the idea to a far greater degree than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Fresnel ever contemplated, and in some instances even
anticipated the latter’s subsequent modifications and improvements.
This was demonstrated more particularly in
the holophotal revolving apparatus, the first example of
which he designed for the North Ronaldshay lighthouse in
1850, a similar apparatus being devised some years later by
Fresnel. In 1862 another great improvement was made by
Mr. J.&nbsp;T. Chance, of the well-known lighthouse engineering
firm of Birmingham, which proved so successful that it was
incorporated for first and third order apparatuses in the
New Zealand lights designed by Messrs. Stevenson in the
same year.</p>

<p class="captionc">(<i>By permission of Messrs. Chance Bros. and Co., Ltd.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>The French and British investigators, however, were not
having things entirely their own way. The United States
played a part in these developments, although they did not
enter very successfully into the problem. The first lighthouse
at Boston Harbour carried candles until superseded
by an ordinary lamp, which was hung in the lantern in much
the same way as it might have been suspended behind the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
window of a private dwelling. An inventor, Mr. Winslow
Lewis, who confessed that he knew nothing about lighthouse
optics, patented what he called a “magnifying and reflecting
lantern” for lighthouse work, which he claimed was a lamp,
a reflector, and a magnifier, all in one. It was as crude a
device as has ever emanated from an inventive brain, but
the designer succeeded in impressing the Government so
effectively that they gave him £4,000, or $20,000, for his
invention. The reflector was wrought of thin copper with
a silvered surface, while the magnifier, the essence of the
invention, was what he called a “lens,” but which in reality
comprised only a circular transparent mass, 9 inches in
diameter, and varying from 2½ to 4 inches in thickness,
made of bottle-green glass. The Government considered
that it had acquired a valuable invention, and was somewhat
dismayed by the blunt opinion of one of its inspectors who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
held contrary views concerning the magnifier, inasmuch as
he reported cynically that its only merit was that it made
“a bad light worse.”</p>

<p>The inventor did not manifest any antagonism to this
criticism, but immediately pointed out the great economy
in the consumption of oil that was arising from the use of
his idea. Indeed, he prosecuted his claims so successfully
that he clinched a profitable bargain to himself with the
Government. His apparatus had been fitted to thirty-four
lights, and he contracted to maintain them on the basis of
receiving one-half of the oil previously consumed by the
lamps which his invention superseded. This arrangement
was in vogue for five years, when it was renewed, with the
difference that on this occasion the Government, concluding
that the inventor was making too much out of the transaction,
reduced the allowance to one-third. Subsequently
the invention received higher commendation from the officials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
than that advanced by the critical inspector, although it
must be pointed out that meanwhile the magnifying bull’s-eye
had been abandoned, and a new type of reflector introduced,
so that the sole remaining feature of the wonderful
invention was the lamp. Even that had been modified.
When the Lighthouse Board was established in 1852 it
abolished the much-discussed invention, and introduced the
Fresnel system, bringing the United States into line with the
rest of the world.</p>

<p>One feature of the subject cannot fail to arrest attention.
This is the possibility of producing a variety of combinations
by the aid of the lenses to fulfil different requirements. The
Fresnel, Stevenson, and Chance developments in the science
of lighthouse optics facilitated this work very significantly.
Accordingly, to-day a variety of lights, evolved from the
variations in the mounting of the lenses, is in vogue. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
purposes of identification they have been divided into a
number of classifications, and, for the convenience of the
navigator, are described as lights of the first order, second
order, and so on. Broadly speaking, there are seven main
groups, or orders, the rating only applying to dioptric or
catadioptric lights, indicating the bending of the luminous
rays in the desired direction, either by refraction and reflection
through the medium of prisms, or a combination of
both. Actually there is a distinction between these two,
the true dioptric system referring only to refraction, where
the ray is bent in the desired direction by a glass agent,
known as a “refracting prism.” In the catadioptric system, on
the other hand, both methods are employed, since the prism
performs the dual purpose of reflecting and refracting the
rays. However, in modern lighthouse parlance both are
grouped under the one distinction “dioptric.”</p>

<p>The rating or classification of the lights varies according
to the inside radius or focal distance of the lens&mdash;in other
words, the distance from the centre of the light to the inner
surface of the lens. The main groups are as follows:</p>

<p>The most powerful apparatus used to-day, however, is
that known as the “hyperradiant,” and it is the largest
which has yet been devised. For this, lighthouse engineering
is indebted to Messrs. Stevenson, the engineers to the Commissioners
of Northern Lighthouses. It was first suggested
as far back as 1869, and experiments were carried out which
emphasized the fact that such an apparatus was required,
since it was found that when large gas-burners were used
much of the light in revolving apparatuses was out of focus
and escaped condensation. The Scottish engineers thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
suggested that an apparatus should be used having
a focal distance of 1,330 millimetres, or 52·3 inches. In
fact, they went farther and suggested even larger apparatuses,
but this idea has not matured. But it was not until
1885 that Messrs. Stevenson had such a system manufactured,
and then it was tested at the South Foreland beside
the powerful lenses which had just been built for the new
Eddystone and the Mew Island lighthouses. The merits
of the theories advanced by Messrs. Stevenson were then
completely proved, for it was found that with a ten-ring
gas-burner the hyperradiant apparatus threw a light nearly
twice as powerful as that given by the rival lenses with the
same burner.</p>

Four Panels.</span></p>

<p class="captionc">(<i>By permission of Messrs. Chance Bros. and Co., Ltd.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>At the present moment the hyperradiant is regarded as
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultima thule</i> of lighthouse optical engineering, and Messrs.
Chance Brothers and Co., of Birmingham, have built some
very magnificent apparatuses of this order. At present there
are not more than a dozen such powerful lights in operation.
Three are on the English coast, at Bishop Rock, Spurn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Point, and Round Island, respectively; two in Scotland, at
Fair Isle and Sule Skerry; two in Ireland, at Bull Rock and
Tory Island; one in France, at Cap d’Antifer; one in China,
at Pei Yu-shan; one in India, at Manora Point, Karachi;
and the Cape Race light in Newfoundland. The hyperradiant
apparatus is a massive cage of glass, standing some
12 feet in height, and, as may be supposed, is extremely
expensive.</p>

<p>There is another point in lighthouse optics which demands
explanation. This is the term “divergence,” which plays an
important part in the duration of the flash. In speaking
about focus, the engineer follows somewhat in Euclid’s footsteps
in regard to the definition of a point; in a way it is
equally imaginary. The focal point does not mean the
whole of the flame, but the centre of the luminous source,
and, as is obvious, it is impossible to secure a flame without
dimensions. It may be an attenuated, round, oval, or fan-shaped
light&mdash;the result is the same. The focal point is the
theoretical centre of the luminous source, and the rays,
coming from the top, sides, and bottom of the flame cannot
come from the true focus. If they did, all the light from
one panel would be emitted in absolutely parallel lines, and
therefore in a revolving apparatus the beam would pass any
given point on the horizon in an infinitely short period of
time&mdash;to be precise, instantaneously. But the ex-focal rays
of the flame, in passing through the lens, emerge at an angle
to those coming from the absolute centre, so that the whole
beam becomes “diverged,” and throws a cone of light from
the lens. Consequently the beam occupies an appreciable
period of time in passing a given point on the horizon.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the intricate character of the lenses
constituting the optical apparatus of the modern lighthouse
demands the highest skill and infinite care in their
preparation, while the composition of the glass itself is a
closely guarded secret. There are less than half a dozen
firms in the world engaged in this delicate and highly
specialized work, of which France claims three, Germany one,
and Great Britain one. All the lighthouse authorities of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
various nations have to secure their requirements from one
or other of these organizations. The industry commenced
in France, and for many years the French reigned supreme.
Then it contrived to make its entrance into England, and
was taken up by the family of Chance in Birmingham, who
soon proved themselves equal to their French leaders.</p>

<p class="captionc">(<i>By permission of Messrs. Chance Bros. and Co., Ltd.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>The British firm has established a unique reputation, as
it has been responsible for the majority of the great lights
of the world, some of which are not only of huge dimensions
and weight, but also of novel form. The hyperradial apparatuses
which have been placed recently in the towers of
Manora Point and Cape Race probably rank as the most
powerful and the finest in existence. These are used in
conjunction with the petroleum vapour incandescent burner.
The Cape Race light, for instance, comprises a revolving
optic of four panels, subtending a horizontal angle of
90 degrees, with a vertical angle of 121½ degrees. Each lens
comprises the central disc, or bull’s-eye, around which are
placed nine rings of glass, giving a total refracting angle of
57 degrees. In order to bend the vertical rays into a horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
path twenty-two catadioptric reflecting prisms are
disposed above the lens, while below are thirteen similar
prisms. The total amount of glass worked into the four
panels is about 6,720 pounds, and the prisms are mounted
in gun-metal frames, which weigh approximately 4,800
pounds, so that the total weight of the glass portion and its
mounting alone, standing some 12 feet in height, is over
11,500 pounds. The installation completed for the equipment
of the Manora Point lighthouse, Karachi, is very similar.</p>

<p>In some cases the demand for a powerful light has been
met with a system differing from the “hyperradiant.”
The lenses and respective groups of refractors are superimposed,
each tier having its individual burner and flues for
carrying off the products of combustion. In this way we
have the biform, comprising two such panels arranged one
above the other, as in the Fastnet and Eddystone lights;
and the quadriform, wherein four tiers are built one above
the other, as installed at the Mew Island light in Ireland.
The advantage of this arrangement is that a beam of great
intensity is secured with a lantern of comparatively small
diameter.</p>

<p>The French authorities adopted a modification of this
system. Instead of placing two lenses and refractors one
above the other, they ranged them side by side, the effect
being analogous to a couple of squinting eyes, the panels
being parallel and therefore throwing out parallel beams.
But these adaptations have not come into extensive use,
as they have been superseded by more simple means of
achieving similar requirements with an even more powerful
ray. The hyperradiant stands as the finest type of apparatus
yet devised, and therefore is employed when an
extremely powerful light is required.</p>

<p>While the design and arrangement of the optical apparatus
is certainly a most vital and delicate task, the mounting
thereof upon a substantial support in such a way that it may
perform its work with the highest efficiency is equally
imperative, since the finest apparatus might be very adversely
affected by being improperly mounted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

followed by a Single Flash.</span></p>

<p class="captionc">(<i>By permission of Messrs. Chance Bros. and Co., Ltd.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>Obviously, owing to the great weight of the glass, the
support must be heavy and substantial. A massive cast-iron
pedestal is employed for this purpose. When the light
is of the revolving character, means have to be incorporated
to secure the requisite rotation. In the early days the
turntable upon which the lens is mounted ran upon rollers,
but now a very much better system is universally employed.
This has been brought to a high standard of perfection by
Messrs. Chance of Birmingham, who have carried out unceasing
experiments in this field. The objection to rollers
was the enormous friction that was set up, and the great
effort that was required, not only to set the lenses revolving,
but to keep them rotating at a steady pace. In the modern
apparatus the rollers are superseded by an iron trough filled
with mercury, upon which floats the turntable carrying the
lenses. When the apparatus is properly built and balanced,
the friction is so slight that the turntable can be set in motion
by the little finger, notwithstanding that several tons have
to be moved. Although the optical part of the apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
floats upon the bed of quicksilver in the same way as a cork
lifebelt floats upon water, it is provided with rollers which
serve to hold the whole apparatus steady and to overcome
any oscillation.</p>

<p>In the case of an immense apparatus such as a hyperradiant
lens, which, together with the turntable, may have
a total weight of 17,000 pounds, an enormous quantity of
mercury is required. The trough of the Cape Race hyperradiant
light carries 950 pounds of quicksilver, upon which
the lantern is floated. In such an instance, also, the pedestal
is a weighty part of the apparatus, representing in this
case about 26,800 pounds, so that the complete apparatus
utilized to throw the 1,100,000 candle-power beam from
the guardian of the Newfoundland coast aggregates, when
in working order, some 44,000 pounds, or approximately
20 tons.</p>

<p>Within the base of the pedestal is mounted the mechanism
for rotating the optical apparatus. This is of the clockwork
type driven by a weight. The latter moves up and down a
tube which extends vertically to a certain depth through
the centre of the tower. The weight of the driving force
and the depth of its fall naturally vary according to the
character of the light. In the Cape Race light the weight
is of 900 pounds, and it falls 14½ feet per hour. Similarly,
the length of time which the clock will run on one winding
fluctuates. As a rule it requires to be rewound once every
sixty or ninety minutes. A longer run is not recommended,
as it would demand a longer weight-tube, while many
authorities prefer the frequent winding, as the man on duty
is kept on the alert thereby. As the weight approaches the
bottom of its tube it sets an electric bell or gong in action,
which serves to warn the light-keeper that the mechanism
demands rewinding.</p>

Distance of Lens from 150 to 1,330 Millimetres.</span></p>

<p class="captionc">(<i>By permission of Messrs. Chance Bros. and Co., Ltd.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>The weight and clockwork mechanism perfected by
Messrs. Chance is regarded as one of the best in service. The
rotation is perfect and even, owing to the governing system
incorporated, while the steel wire carrying the weight is
preferable to the chain, which is subject to wear and is noisy<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_44">44</a><a  id="Page_45">45</a></span>
in action. In the Chance clockwork gear the weight is just
sufficient to start the apparatus from a state of rest, the
advantage of such a method being that, should the apparatus
be stopped in its revolution from any untoward incident, it
is able to restart itself.</p>

<p>Of course, the clockwork mechanism is required only in
those cases where the lenticular apparatus has to be revolved.
This introduces the question of avoiding confusion between
lights. When beacons were first brought into service, the
lights were of the fixed type, and the navigator, although
warned by the glare to keep away from the spot so marked,
was given no information as to his position. Accordingly,
lighthouse engineers sought to assist him in this direction
during the blackness of the night by providing a ready visual
means of identification. Owing to the ingenuity which has
been displayed, it has been rendered possible to ring the
changes upon a light very extensively.</p>

But it may so happen that the lighthouse, owing to its
position and the dangerous character of the spot which it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
marks, carries a light which changes colour from white to
red or green, which are shown alternately in various combinations.

<p>In timing a revolving or flashing light, the cycle is taken
from the beginning of one flash to the beginning of the next.
In these readings the flash is always shorter than the
duration of the eclipse, while an occultation is shorter than,
or equal to, the length of the light interval. Since flashing
and occulting may be carried out with a fixed light suddenly
extinguished or eclipsed, the characterization is determined
solely according to the relative duration of light and darkness,
irrespective of the type of apparatus employed or the
relative brilliancy. There is one peculiarity of the flashing
light which may be remarked. At short distances and in
clear weather a faint continuous light may be shown.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the development of the optical apparatus
has been the wonderful improvement in regard to
the illuminants and the methods of producing a brilliant
clear flame. The fuel first used upon the introduction of
the oil lamp was sperm or colza oil, the former being obtained
from the whale, and the latter from seeds and a wild-cabbage.
Both were very expensive, so that the maintenance of a light
was costly&mdash;so much so that the United States authorities
devoted their efforts to the perfection of a high-class lard-oil.
This proved highly satisfactory, possessing only one
drawback. In winter it congealed so much under the low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
temperature that it had to be heated before it could be placed
in the lamp; but once the light was set going, the heat
radiated from the burner served to keep the oil sufficiently
fluid to enable it to mount the wick to the point of combustion
under capillary action.</p>

<p>So far as the American authorities were concerned, the
advantages of lard-oil sufficed to bring a cheaper medium
than colza-oil into vogue. A company, which had been
induced by the Government to install an elaborate and expensive
plant for the production of colza-oil, after prolonged
experiment and efforts to reduce the cost of production,
announced that it could not compete with the lard-oil, and
suggested that the latter should be employed in preference
to the colza. The Government agreed, but, to compensate
the company for its trouble, purchased the plant which the
latter had laid down.</p>

<p>The advances in the processes for refining petroleum, and
the exploitation of the extensive resources of the latter, led
to “earth-oil,” in some form or other, being employed for
lighthouse purposes. The attempt was facilitated by the
invention and improvement of the Argand burner, whereby
a brilliant white annular sheet of flame is produced. Various
lighthouse engineers devoted their attention to the improvement
of this burner in conjunction with paraffin. Their
results were completely successful, and at last paraffin
became universally utilized as the cheapest and most efficient
illuminant known.</p>

<p>The general method of feeding the lamps was to pump the
oil from a low level to the burner, thereby producing practically
a pressure-feed system in preference to the capillary
action which is used in the ordinary household lamp. By
increasing the number of rings the intensity of the flame
was increased, until at last it was thought that with this
development perfection had been attained so far as lamps
were concerned.</p>

<p>Then came another radical revolution. The invention of
the incandescent gas mantle by Dr. von Auer, and the
complete change that it wrought in connection with gas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
lighting, induced lighthouse engineers to experiment in this
field. As they could not use coal-gas, they devoted their
investigations to the perfection of a gas from petroleum,
which should be capable of combustion with the incandescent
burner. Many years were devoted to these experiments,
and many petroleum vapour systems were devised. One of
the best known, most successful, and most scientifically
perfect, is the Chance incandescent light. This burner is
used in many of the most powerful lights of the world and
has given complete satisfaction. The mantle varies in size
with the size and type of the light, ranging from 35 to 85
millimetres in diameter, the latter, in conjunction with a
hyperradial apparatus, producing a light exceeding 1,000,000
candle-power.</p>

KARACHI, INDIA.</p>

<p class="captionc">Of 1,330 millimetres focus, this is the most powerful and largest lighthouse apparatus made.</p></div></div>

<p>Not only was a far more powerful light obtained in this
manner with the assistance of the petroleum vapour burner
and incandescent mantle, but the cost of maintaining the
light was reduced, owing to the great economy in oil consumption
that was effected thereby, the largest mantle and
burner&mdash;85 millimetres&mdash;burning only 2½ pints of oil per
hour. The light thus obtained, while being vastly superior
to that derived from a six-wick oil-burner, enables a saving
of nearly £48, or $240, per annum to be recorded, taking the
cost of the petroleum at 1s., or 25 cents, per gallon delivered
to the lighthouse.</p>

<p>While petroleum is generally used, some countries have
adopted other oil fuels for small permanent lights. Thus,
in Germany compressed oil-gas, water-gas associated with
benzine vapour, and Blau liquid gas, are utilized. The last-named
is coming very extensively into vogue, also, in Holland,
Denmark, and Austria. Blau gas has the advantage that
it can be transported in small steel tanks under extremely
high pressure&mdash;up to 100 atmospheres, or approximately
1,400 pounds per square inch. It is an extract of oil-gas
produced at a low pressure in the gas retorts, and then
compressed so severely that it liquefies. The fuel, as it is
drawn from the cylinder in which it is stored, has the pressure
reduced by means of a valve, so that it reaches the burner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
in a gaseous form at a pressure equivalent to that of the coal-gas
used in private houses, and is burned in the same way
with an incandescent mantle. The advantage of this
method lies in the facility with which large volumes of gas
may be transported, a steel cylinder containing 7,500 cubic
feet weighing only 132 pounds. It is also inexpensive, a
bottle of the foregoing capacity costing only 12s. 6d., or $3.
In some cases the incandescent mantles, the average life
of which is about a fortnight, are of large diameter, running
up to 100 millimetres, or about 4 inches.</p>

of Stockholm, the inventor of the Dalén flasher and
sun-valve, which are described elsewhere, has introduced a
new illuminant, which is coming into vogue, especially on
the Continent. This is called “Daléngas,” and is a mixture
of 9 per cent. dissolved acetylene and 91 per cent. atmospheric
air. Here the dissolved acetylene gas is conducted
from a storage reservoir or high-pressure gas cylinder, of
special construction, to a governor, where the pressure is
reduced, and then to the mixing apparatus, where the
acetylene gas is associated with the air in the above proportions.
The idea of this combination and method is to
enable an acetylene gas mixture to be used with the ordinary
incandescent mantles.</p>

<p>FIRST ORDER TRIPLE FLASHING LIGHT OF 920 MILLIMETRES
FOCAL DISTANCE FOR CHILANG LIGHTHOUSE, CHINA.</p></div></div>

<p>The advantage of the Daléngas, according to present
experience, is the increased candle-power that is obtainable
as compared with other systems, the superiority being about
75 per cent. under ordinary conditions. With the largest
Fresnel lenses a lighting power of 200,000 Hefner candle-power
is secured, while with revolving lenses of the latest type
a beam of 3,000,000 candle-power can be obtained. The flame
is small, and thus becomes concentrated more in the focus of
the lens, so that the divergence of the light may be diminished
if desired. When a light of a certain range is to be
installed, the optical apparatus can be made smaller for
Daléngas than for other illuminants, and the cost is reduced
correspondingly. Similarly, if the system is introduced
into an existing light, the latter can be made appreciably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
more powerful, without changing the optical apparatus or
affecting the divergence.</p>

<p>In this system the gas is conducted into the lens apparatus
from above, and the lighting arrangement is quite independent
of, and does not interfere in any way with, the revolving
apparatus, while the time spent in changing the mantle is
less than half a minute.</p>

<p>All combustible gases, mixed with air in certain proportions,
may produce more or less violent detonations when
fired. But the quantity of mixed gas in this instance is
confined in the length of piping between the burner and the
mixing apparatus, and this quantity is so small that an
explosion cannot be dangerous. In fact, all such danger has
been guarded against completely&mdash;is, indeed, impossible in
any circumstances.</p>

<p>Electric light has been adopted in one or two cases; but
while the foremost authorities agree that it throws the best,
most brilliant and most powerful beam of light, the system is
generally impracticable on account of its great cost. When
tests with this light were made some years ago in comparison
with the light thrown from oil burners, it was claimed
that the latter, owing to its reddish-yellow tinge, was the
most suitable from the all-round point of view, and that it
could penetrate to a greater distance in foggy weather. I
have been informed by several authorities, who have gone
more deeply into this question since, that this is a fallacy,
and that the advantage rests completely with electric light.
Experience in Germany, which has two magnificent electric
lighthouses, and in Scotland, certainly supports this contention,
and I have been assured that the sole reason why
electric lighting has not been adopted more widely is the
heavy cost, both of installation and of maintenance. When
electric lighting is rendered cheaper and is brought more
to the level of existing lighting arrangements, one may
expect another complete change in lighthouse practice.
In this direction, as explained in another chapter, the
Germans have carried out practical experiments in their
characteristic manner, and have brought the cost of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
maintaining a most powerful electric light to the minimum.</p>

<p>One very great advantage of the electric light is the ease
with which the power of the beam may be increased during
thick weather, so as to secure penetration to the greatest
distance, and decreased to suit easier conditions in clear
weather.</p>

<p>This point raises the question, “From how far can a light
be seen out at sea?” This factor is influenced by climatic
conditions, and also by the curvature of the earth. The
higher the light, or the spectator, or both, is elevated above
the water, the greater the distance from which the light can
be seen. The table on p. <a href="#table52">52</a>, prepared by Mr. Alan Stevenson,
the eminent Scottish lighthouse engineer, gives the
distances at which objects can be seen at sea, according to
the respective elevations of the object and the eye of the
observer.</p>

<p>For instance, the passenger on a liner the boat-deck of
which is 40 feet above the water, approaching the English
Channel, will sight the Bishop Rock light from a distance
of about 22 miles, because the focal plane&mdash;that is, the bull’s-eye
of the lens&mdash;is 163 feet above the water, which, according
to the following table, equals about 14½ miles, to which must
be added the height of the boat’s deck, 40 feet representing
7·25 miles. Similarly, the ray of the Belle Ile light will
come into view when the vessel is 32½ miles distant&mdash;height
of focal plane of light, 470 feet = 25 miles, + eye of
observer on board the liner, 45 feet = 7·69 miles; while the
Navesink light, being 246 feet above the water, may be
picked up by the captain of a liner from a distance of
28 miles. The range of many lights, however, owing to
the curvature of the earth, is greatly in excess of their
geographical range, and with the most powerful lights the
glare of the luminous beams sweeping the clouds overhead
may be seen for a full hour or more before the ray itself
comes into view.</p>

<p>LOOKING UP THE LANTERN OF THE NEEDLES LIGHTHOUSE.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
So far as the candle-power of any light is concerned, the
method of determining this factor, varying according to the
calculating methods adopted, is somewhat misleading. So
far as Great Britain is concerned, the practice of setting out
the candle-power of any light in the official list has been
abandoned, the authorities merely stating that such and
such a light is of great power. The United States and
Canada, on the other hand, indicate the approximate candle-power.</p>

<p>FIXED APPARATUS OF THE FOURTH ORDER FOR SARAWAK.</p>

<p class="captionc">The focal distance is 250 millimetres, and the diameter of lantern inside
glazing 6 feet 7¾ inches.</p></div></div>

<p>By combining and arranging the integral parts of the
optical apparatus, the lighthouse engineer is able to accomplish
many astonishing results. Thus, while the various
types generally follow accepted broad lines, coinciding with
the order which they represent, here and there some very
striking divergences are made. The Bell Rock light is
perhaps the most interesting example in this direction. It
was designed by Messrs. D. and T. Stevenson, and built
by Messrs. Chance Brothers and Co. The light is alternating,
the colours being white and red. Externally the
optical apparatus appears to be bizarre, yet it is one of the
most perfect which has ever been installed. In its design
and construction almost all the known lighthouse optical
elements are incorporated, including the equiangular refractor,
the reflecting prism, the double-reflecting prism, and
the dioptric mirror. Another noteworthy fact is that, by an
exceedingly ingenious arrangement, the absorption of the
rays by the glass used in producing the red flashes is neutralized
to such a vast degree that the white and red flashes are
of equal intensity.</p>

<p>The subsidiary light is another striking feature which the
lighthouse engineer has introduced. For instance, a light
may be shown from a dangerous reef, and give the mariner
all the warning desired. But some distance away may lurk
another isolated rock, which it is just as imperative to indicate,
and yet on which another tower cannot be erected.
This necessity is met by the subsidiary light. A portion of
the light from the main apparatus is deflected and thrown to
the desired spot by an ingenious arrangement of the prisms.
On the west coast of Scotland, at Stornoway, a stream of
light used to be deflected from the lantern in a vertical<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_54">54</a><a  id="Page_55">55</a></span>
direction down the tower, and there bent at right angles, to
be thrown through a lower window and fall upon a prism
placed on the crest of a rock several hundred feet distant.
From the deck of a vessel, the effect of the light striking the
prism was akin to that produced by a beacon. Similarly in
the case of St. Catherine’s light in the Isle of Wight: a portion
of the light, which would otherwise be wasted over the area
on the landward side, is carried vertically down the tower
by a disposal of lenses and prisms, and is projected horizontally
through a small window, after being coloured into a
red ray by passing through some glass of the desired tint, to
mark a danger spot some distance away. This method,
however, is not favoured now, as the peril can be more
efficiently marked by means of an independent beacon, a
system which has become feasible owing to the vast improvements
that have been made in automatic lights requiring no
attention for several weeks or months at a time.</p>

<p>But in those instances where the latter expedient is not
adopted, the practice is to cover the danger with a ray thrown
from an entirely different light. When the present Eddystone
tower was completed, a “low-light room,” as it is
called, was incorporated, and a low-powered light was thrown
from two Argand burners and reflectors through a window
to mark a dangerous reef some three miles distant. But
perhaps the best example of a subsidiary light is that which
was carried out by Messrs. Chance in connection with the
Cap de Couedie lighthouse. In this instance two dangers
had to be indicated in a subsidiary manner, one being
covered with a red, the other with a green, ray. The red
sector marks a danger spot known as Lipson’s Reef, lying
8¾ miles distant, while the green light indicates Casuarina
Island, 1¾ miles away. This installation, it may be pointed
out, has proved highly successful, and certainly is very
economical.</p>

the Main Light to form a Subsidiary Light.</span></p>

<p class="captionc">(<i>By permission of Messrs. Chance Bros. and Co., Ltd.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>There is another point which deserves mention&mdash;the
duration of the flash in a revolving light. There was considerable
discussion and difference of opinion upon this
question some years ago. It was maintained that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
shorter the duration of the flash, and the more rapidly it
were thrown, the better it would be for the mariner. The
Scottish engineers realized the significance of this problem,
and, despite the hostile criticism of contemporary engineers,
adopted a specific principle which was to give a flash of
two and three-quarter seconds’ duration. Subsequently it
was reduced to one second. The introduction of the mercury
float enabled the optical apparatus to be revolved faster,
and also facilitated the reduction in the number of panels
or faces, so that ultimately the Scottish engineers reduced
the flash to one of four-tenths of a second.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bourdelles devised the mercury float which
enabled rotation to be accelerated, the French authorities
rushed to the opposite extreme. They reduced the faces
to four, and arranged for the apparatus to be revolved at a
high speed, so that the duration of the flash was only one-tenth
of a second at rapidly-recurring intervals. This type
of light was called the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feu-éclair</i>, and was adopted as a
result of prolonged laboratory investigation. But this was
an instance where laboratory experiments and scientific
reasoning failed to go hand in glove with practical experience
and navigation, where the mariner has to contend with all
sorts and conditions of weather. The seafarer expressed his
opinion of the one-tenth of a second flash in uncomplimentary
terms, displaying an indifferent appreciation of artificially-produced
sheet-lightning.</p>

<p>Eventually there was a general agreement, among all those
countries which had investigated the problem closely, that a
flash of about three-tenths of a second was the most satisfactory,
and this has since become tacitly standardized.
The French authorities recognized the fallacy of their idea,
and soon came into line with the other countries.</p>

<span class="subhead">FOG-SIGNALS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the wonderful ingenuity that is displayed
in the concentration of light into powerful beams, these all
count for nothing when fog settles upon the sea. The ray of
1,000,000 candle-power is almost as futile then as the glimmer
from a tallow dip.</p>

<p>Fog is the peril of the sea which the mariner dreads more
than any other. The blanket of mist, descending upon the
water, not only shuts everything from sight, but deadens
every sound as well. The sea is absolutely calm, so that
no intimation of danger ahead is conveyed by the breaking
of the waves upon rock, shoal, sandbank, or iron-bound
coast.</p>

<p>It is in times of fog that the navigator must be given the
greatest protection. As this is impossible to accomplish
visually, appeal must be made to his ear. In the early days
of lighthouse engineering the methods of conveying audible
warning were very crude. The discharge of a gun was the
most popular, but it was neither serviceable nor reliable, and
was made upon somewhat haphazard lines. Thus, in the
case of a dangerous headland on the North American coast,
which the Boston steamer had to round on its journey, the
keepers mounted guard at the probable time of the vessel’s
arrival off this point. They listened eagerly for the steamer’s
whistle, and when it came screaming over the water they
began hurriedly firing a carronade, keeping up the blank-cartridge
bombardment until another shriek told them that
those on the vessel had heard their signals. Sometimes the
whistle was heard from a distance of six miles; at others
from not more than two miles away. It depended upon
circumstances. Obviously, such a primitive system was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
attended with considerable danger, as an accident was liable
to happen to the men in their feverish haste to load and
discharge the gun, while the plight of the boat was far from
being enviable at times.</p>

<p>A MODERN LIGHTHOUSE SIREN PLANT.</p>

<p class="captionc">Showing gas engines and air-compressors in duplicate, with siren at side.</p></div></div>

<p>In the early days every lighthouse tower was provided
with a heavy bell. Indeed, the ponderous dome of metal
projecting from the lantern gallery was considered indispensable.
The bell varied in weight from 1,200 to 2,240
pounds, was fitted with a massive clapper, and when struck
emitted a deep musical note. In order to enable the seafarer
to gain some idea of his whereabouts, the fog-signals
were given a sound-characteristic somewhat upon the lines
of those in connection with the light. Thus, one lighthouse
would give one stroke every ten seconds; another would
give two strokes in quick succession, followed by a long
silence, and so on. This system suffers from the severe
handicap that the sound does not travel very far during
foggy weather.</p>

<p>Another ingenious engineer recommended the utilization
of the locomotive whistle, giving a high-toned, ear-piercing
shriek, but the same objection as attended the use of the
bell prevailed: the sound could not be heard more than
a short distance away. The British lighthouse authorities
submitted the idea to a series of searching investigations to
ascertain its possibilities, but eventually were compelled to
conclude that it was not superior to, if as good as, the other
systems then in vogue. The United States authorities, as a
result of their independent experiments, expressed a similar
opinion; but in Canada practical application gave this
whistle a favourable verdict.</p>

<p>Rockets also have been adopted, and are highly successful.
Indeed, this method of conveying audible warning
prevails still in many countries. The practicability of such
a means of throwing sound over a wide area was advanced
by Sir Richard Collinson, when Deputy-Master of Trinity
House, and his idea comprised the insertion of a gun-cotton
charge, timed to explode at a given height, in the head of
the rocket. The height could be varied up to about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
1,000 feet, and the weight of the charge fluctuated according
to requirements. The rocket system was tested very
severely, and in some instances the report was heard as
many as twenty-five miles away. It received the approbation
of Professor Tyndall, and, although superior methods of
signalling have been devised since, there remain one or two
lighthouse stations where it is considered to be the most
satisfactory fog-signalling device, notably the station on the
island of Heligoland, where the rocket is hurled into the air
to explode at a height of nearly 700 feet.</p>

<p>In many lighthouses the detonation of gun-cotton constitutes
the means of conveying warning to passing vessels,
but is accomplished in a different manner. The charge,
instead of being sent into the air to be exploded, is attached
to a special device which is supported upon a simple frame
at a point above the lantern, so that no damage may be
inflicted upon the glass of the latter from the concussion.
The apparatus is fitted with a safety device which prevents
premature explosion, so that the keeper is preserved from
personal injury, and, unless culpable negligence is manifested,
the charge cannot be ignited until it has been raised
to its designed position. The report is of great volume,
and as a rule can be heard a considerable distance; but in
this, as in all other cases, the atmosphere plays many strange
tricks. Still, it has not been superseded yet for isolated
sea-rock lighthouses, such as the Eddystone, Skerryvore,
and Bell Rock, where there is lack of adequate space for
the installation of any other equally efficient fog-signalling
facilities.</p>

<p>THE SIRENS OF THE LIZARD.</p>

<p class="captionl">Owing to the importance of the Lizard Station and the fact that the coast often is obscured by fog,
a powerful fog-signalling station is imperative.</p></div></div>

<p>In the early seventies an American investigator, Mr. C.&nbsp;L.
Daboll, contrived an entirely new system, which developed
into the foundation of one of the most successful fog-signalling
devices for lighthouses which has been discovered&mdash;the
siren. The Daboll invention was a huge trumpet, recalling
a mammoth phonograph horn. It was 17 feet in
length, and its mouth was 38 inches in diameter. In the
lower end of this trumpet&mdash;the throat&mdash;was placed a tongue
of steel measuring 10 inches in length and secured at one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
end to form a reed. It was blown by air compressed in a
reservoir to the desired degree, and then permitted to escape
through the trumpet. The mad rush of the expanding air
through the constricted passage set the reed vibrating
violently, causing the emission of a penetrating, discordant
bellow. When Daboll commenced his experiments, he suffered
from the lack of a suitable mechanical means for
compressing the air, and made shift with a donkey for this
purpose until the hot-air engine was improved, when the
latter was substituted.</p>

<p>Trinity House adopted the idea and found it serviceable;
but the Canadian authorities, after four years’ experiment,
dissented from this view, remarking that the trumpet was
expensive to maintain, unreliable in working, and liable to
break down when most urgently needed. In fact, they
characterized the Daboll trumpets which they had installed
as “sources of danger instead of aids to navigation.”</p>

<p>From the trumpet to the siren was not a very big step.
The history of the latter’s invention is somewhat obscure,
but it was brought before the United States Government in
a primitive form. The American engineers, recognizing its
latent possibilities, took it up, and endeavoured to improve
it to such a degree as to render it suitable for lighthouse
work. Their efforts were only partially successful. The
solution of the many difficulties attending its perfection was
effected in Great Britain by Professor Frederick Hale Holmes,
whose magneto-electric machine brought electricity within
reach of the lighthouse as an illuminant, and it was due to
the efforts of this scientist that the siren became one of the
most efficient sound-producing instruments which have been
discovered for this class of work.</p>

<p>The reason that made Professor Holmes bring his energies
and knowledge to bear upon this subject was somewhat
curious. The siren in its first form made its way from the
United States to Great Britain. The British Admiralty
realized the power and penetration of its sound, and forthwith
adopted it in the navy, operating it by steam instead
of by air. At this there arose a great outcry from the mercantile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
marine. Captains argued that the similarity of the
signals confused and often misled them, as they could not
tell in the fog whether the sound proceeded from a warship
or a lighthouse. The Board of Trade was forced to intervene,
but, as it had no jurisdiction over the Admiralty, it
sought to extricate itself from an awkward situation by
inviting Professor Holmes to perfect a siren which would
emit a distinctive sound. His efforts were crowned with
complete success.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.&mdash;The Fixed (A) and Revolving (B) Parts of the
Siren.</span></div></div>

<p>Professor Holmes exhibited his wonderful device at the
Paris Exhibition of 1867. He installed it in working order,
and the visitors displayed an anxiety to hear it. It was
brought into action, and those around never forgot the experience.
It was the most diabolical ear-splitting noise
which had been heard, and, apprehensive that serious results
might arise from its demonstration when the buildings were
thronged with sight-seers, the authorities refused to permit
it to be sounded again. The humorous illustrated papers
did not suffer such a golden opportunity to escape. Grotesque
and laughable cartoons appeared depicting the curious
effects produced by the blast of the instrument, one showing
the various statues being frightened off their pedestals
proving exceptionally popular.</p>

<p>The siren in its simplest form is an enlarged edition of
the “Deviline” toy whistle. There is a Daboll trumpet
with a small throat, in which is placed horizontally, not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
reed, but a metal disc, so as to fill the whole circular space
of the throat. The sheet of metal is pierced with a number
of radial slits. Behind this disc is a second plate of a similar
character, and likewise pierced with radial slits of the same
size, shape and number; but whereas the first disc is fixed,
the second is mounted on a spindle. The free disc rotates
at high speed, so that the twelve jets of air which are driven
through the throat are interrupted intermittently by the
blanks of the revolving disc coming over the openings in the
fixed disc, while when the two slits are in line the air has
a free passage. If the revolving disc completes 3,000 revolutions
per minute, and there are twelve slits in the discs,
then a total of 36,000 vibrations per minute is produced
while the instrument is in operation. The speed of the
revolving disc, as well as the number and size of the openings,
varies according to the size and class of the siren; but in
any case an intensely powerful, dense and penetrating
musical tone is emitted, which can be heard a considerable
distance away. The blast of a high-powered large siren
has been heard at a distance of twenty to thirty miles in
clear weather, though of course in thick weather its range
is reduced.</p>

<p>While Professor Holmes was experimenting with this
device, another investigator, Mr. Slight, of Trinity House,
was wrestling with the same problem. Indeed, he may be
described as the inventor of the modern siren. Although
he effected only an apparently slight modification, it was
the touch which rendered the instrument perfect, while it
also removed the possibility of a breakdown at a critical
moment, as he rendered the moving part freer in its working
and eliminated the severe strains to which it was subjected.
The improvement was appreciated by Professor
Holmes, who adopted it immediately.</p>

<p>While these indefatigable efforts were in progress, ingenious
attempts were made to press Nature herself into
operation. As is well known, there are many “blowing-holes”
distributed throughout the world, where the water
by erosion has produced a long, narrow cavern in the base<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
of a rock, with a constricted outlet into the outer air. The
waves, rushing into the cave, compress the air within, which,
in its escape at high velocity through the small vent, produces
a bellowing sound. It was this curious phenomenon
which gave the Wolf Rock its name. General Hartmann
Bache, of the United States Engineers, attempted in 1858
to make use of a blowing-hole on one of the Farallon Isles,
lying forty miles off the entrance to San Francisco Bay. A
chimney was built with bricks above the orifice, through
which the air compressed by the waves below made its
escape, and on top of this shaft a locomotive whistle was
placed. The first effort was a dead failure, because the
force of the rush of air was so great that it carried away the
chimney; but in the second attempt success was achieved,
and an excellent automatic whistle blared out night and day
almost continuously and was audible for some distance out
to sea. The only drawback was that in foggy weather,
when the most intense sound was required, the signal was
dumb owing to the smoothness of the water. This novel
signal was maintained for some time and then was superseded
by a powerful siren.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting fog-signalling installations in
service is that on the bald formidable hump of rock lying
in the estuary of the Clyde, known as Ailsa Craig. For years
this rock constituted a terrible menace to the crowded
shipping of this important marine thoroughfare, and its
victims were numerous. While the Commissioners of
Northern Lighthouses mitigated its terrors as far as possible
by the provision of a powerful light, they recognized
the fact that a visual warning did not meet the situation
completely. But the installation of a fog-signal was a
somewhat peculiar problem, owing to the configuration of
the rock. A single station would not meet requirements,
because it was necessary to throw the warning from both
sides of the obstruction. The provision of two sound-stations
would have been an expensive matter, even if it had been
feasible, which it was not, owing to the precipitous nature
of the cliffs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
An ingenious solution was advanced by Mr. Charles
Ingrey, C.E. He proposed to erect a central power-station
and to control the sounding of two sirens, placed on opposite
sides of the island, therefrom, the compressed air being led
through underground piping. The plans were submitted to
Messrs. Stevenson, the engineers to the Northern Lighthouse
Board, who, after examining the proposal thoroughly, gave
it their approval. But when it came to obtaining the sanction
for the requisite expenditure from the Board of Trade,
that august body, despite the fact that the project had been
investigated and had received the approbation of the
engineers to the Northern Lighthouse Commissioners, declined
to permit public money to be expended upon an
untried scheme. Such is the way in which pioneering effort
and ingenuity are stifled by Government departments.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE ACETYLENE FOG-GUN.</p>

<p class="captionc">The latest ingenious device for giving both audible and visual
warning automatically.</p></div></div>

<p>Many another engineer would have abandoned the project
after such a rebuff, but Mr. Ingrey without any delay
laid down a complete installation upon the lines he contemplated
on the island of Pladda, where a Holmes fog-horn
was in service. With the aid of a workman whom he took
from Glasgow, the light-keepers and some farm labourers,
this trial installation was completed, the piping being carried
round the island from the air-compressing plant to the fog-signal.
The work occupied about a fortnight, and then,
everything being ready to convince the sceptical Board of
Trade, the inspecting engineers were treated to a comprehensive
and conclusive demonstration. They were satisfied
with what they saw, appreciated the reliability of the idea
and gave the requisite sanction. Forthwith the Ailsa Craig
Island installation was put in hand and duly completed.</p>

<p>This plant possesses many ingenious features. As the
light is derived from gas distilled from crude oil, a small
gas-making plant is installed on the island, and this is used
also for driving a battery of five eight-horse-power gas-engines&mdash;four
are used at a time, the fifth being in reserve&mdash;to
supply the thirty-horse-power demanded to operate the
fog-signal. The energy thus developed drives two sets of
powerful air-compressors, the four cylinders of which have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
a bore of 10 inches by a stroke of 20 inches, the air being
compressed to 80 pounds per square inch and stored in two
large air-receivers which hold 194 cubic feet. From this
reservoir pipes buried in a trench excavated from the solid
rock extend to the two trumpets, placed on the north and
south sides of the island respectively. The length of piping
on the north side is 3,400 feet, and on the south side 2,500
feet. At places where the pipe makes a dip, owing to the
configuration of the rock, facilities are provided to draw off
any water which may collect. Extreme care had to be displayed
in connecting the lengths of piping, so that there
might be no leakage, in which event, of course, the pressure
of the air would drop and thereby incapacitate the signal.</p>

<p class="captionl">A very exposed Scottish rock tower. It is unique because a full-powered
siren fog-signal is installed therein.</p></div></div>

<p>Each signal is mounted in a domed house built of concrete,
the mouth of the trumpet extending from the crown
of the roof. Within the house is an air-receiver 9 feet in
height by 4½ feet in diameter, of about 140 cubic feet
capacity, which receives the compressed air transmitted
through the piping from the compressing-station. It also
contains the automatic apparatus whereby the signal is
brought into action at the stipulated intervals, so as to
produce the requisite sound characteristic. This is a self-winding
clockwork mechanism which admits and cuts off
the supply of air to the trumpets, its chief feature being
that the clock is wound up by the compressed air itself, so
that it is entirely free from human control. However, as a
breakdown even with the best-designed and most-carefully-tended
machinery cannot be circumvented entirely, there is
a duplicate electrical mechanism, also automatically controlled
from the power-generating station, the electric cables
for which are laid in the pipe trenches. This acts as an
emergency control.</p>

<p>The two signals are not sounded simultaneously; neither
are they alike nor of the same tone. The north signal gives
a single blast of high tone, lasting five seconds, and then is
silent for 175 seconds. On the south side the siren gives a
double note, although there are three blasts&mdash;viz., high, low,
high&mdash;corresponding to the letter R of the Morse code. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
notes are sounded for two seconds, with similar intervening
periods of silence, and silence for 170 seconds between the
groups. The complete signal from the two stations is given
once in three minutes, the north signal commencing to sound
ninety seconds after the south signal has ceased. The high
note corresponds to the fourth E in the musical compass,
there being 38,400 vibrations per minute; while the low
note is tuned to the third D in the musical compass, with
16,800 vibrations per minute. The notes are purposely
timed more than an octave apart and made discordant, as
thereby the sound is more likely to attract attention and
to be readily distinguished.</p>

<p>About eighteen minutes are required to bring the apparatus
into operation&mdash;that is, to start compressing and to raise
the pressure of the air to the requisite degree&mdash;but, as fogs
descend upon the Clyde with startling suddenness, the
signals may be started within five minutes of the fog-alarm.
The air-reservoirs are kept charged to the working pressure,
the machinery being run once or twice for a short time every
week for this purpose and to keep the plant in working
order.</p>

<p>Up to this time it had been the practice to place the siren
in close proximity to the air-compressing machinery, but
the installation at Ailsa Craig proves conclusively that this
is not essential to success; also it demonstrates the fact
that a number of signals can be operated reliably and effectively
from a central station. Indeed, this Scottish plant
aroused such widespread interest that the Pulsometer Engineering
Company of Reading, who had acquired Professor
Holmes’s patents and who carried out the above installation,
received several inquiries from abroad with regard to
its suitability for similar situations. In one instance the
compressed air was to be transmitted for a distance of nearly
four miles.</p>

<p>While the siren has been adopted and found adequate by
the majority of nations, the Canadian Government has installed
a far more powerful instrument upon the River St.
Lawrence, as the ordinary siren signals originally established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
near the mouth of the river, although of great power,
were found to be inadequate. The new apparatus, which
is known as the “diaphone,” gives an extraordinarily
powerful sound. It comprises a cylindrical chamber, in the
walls of which are cut a number of parallel slits. Concentrically
disposed within the chamber is a cylindrical hollow
piston, with similar slits and a flange at one end, the whole
being enclosed in an outer casing. Air under pressure is
admitted into the outer casing, and drives the piston backwards
and forwards with great rapidity. The result is that
the air effects its escape through the orifices, when they
come into line, in intermittent puffs.</p>

<p>While the broad principle is not unlike that of the conventional
siren, the main difference is that in the latter
there is a rotary motion, whereas in the diaphone the action
is reciprocating. The great advantage of the latter is that
all the vibrations are synchronous, owing to the symmetrical
disposition of the slits, and consequently the note produced
is very pure. The mechanism is so devised that the piston’s
motion is controlled to a nicety, and the sound is constant.
Experience has proved that the best results are obtained by
using air at a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch. The
sound thus produced is intensified to a markedly greater
degree by means of a resonator properly attuned.</p>

<p>This instrument has displaced the siren among the
stations upon the St. Lawrence River. The general type
of apparatus has a piston 4½ inches in diameter, and uses
11 pounds of air per second during the sounding of the blast.
But at more important stations a far larger and more
powerful class of apparatus is used, the diaphone at Cape
Race having a piston 8½ inches in diameter and using 27 feet
of air per second while sounding. This does not indicate
the limit of size, however, since the builders of this terrible
noise-producer are experimenting with an apparatus having
a piston 14 inches in diameter. The sound issuing from
such a huge apparatus would be almost as deafening as the
report of a big gun and should succeed in warning a mariner
several miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
The atmosphere, however, plays many strange pranks
with the most powerful sound-producing instruments. To-day,
for instance, a fog-signal may be heard at a distance of
ten miles; to-morrow it will fail to be audible more than a
mile away. This aberration of sound is extraordinary and
constitutes one of the unsolved problems of science. Innumerable
investigations have been made with the object
of finding the cause of this erratic action, but no conclusive
explanation has been forthcoming. Another strange trick
is that, while a sound may be audible at distances of two
and four miles during a fog, it fails to strike the ear at three
miles. It is as if the sound struck the water at a range of
two miles, bounded high into the air, and again fell upon
the water at four miles, giving a second leap to hit the water
again farther on, in much the same way as a thin flat stone,
when thrown horizontally into the water, will hop, skip, and
jump over the surface. This trick renders the task of the
lighthouse engineer additionally exasperating and taxes his
ingenuity to the utmost, as it appears to baffle completely
any attempt towards its elimination.</p>

<p>Recently another ingenious and novel system has been
perfected by Messrs. D. and C. Stevenson. This is an acetylene
gun which acts automatically. Hitherto an unattended
fog-signal&mdash;except the bell-buoy tolled by the movement of
the waves, which is far from satisfactory, or the whistling
buoy, which is operated upon the same lines and is equally
ineffective except at very short range&mdash;has found little
favour. The objections to the bell and whistle buoys are
the faintness of the sounds, which may be drowned by the
noises produced on the ship herself; while, if the wind is
blowing away from the vessel, she may pass within a few
feet of the signal, yet outside its range. Thus it will be
recognized that the fog-gun serves to fill a very important
gap in connection with the warning of seafarers during thick
weather.</p>

<p>As is well known, even a small charge of acetylene, when
fired, will produce a loud report, and this characteristic of
the gas induced Messrs. Stevenson to apply it to a fog-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>signal.
They have developed the automatic acetylene
system of lighting to a very high degree around the coasts
of Scotland, and there are now more than twenty lights of
this class, mostly unattended, in operation, some of which
have been established for many years. These lights have
proved highly satisfactory. There has never been an accident,
a freedom which is due to the fact that Moye’s system
is used, wherein the possibilities of mishap are surmounted
very effectively. Accordingly, the engineers saw no reason
why a similar system should not be adapted to the emission
of sound instead of light signals, or, if desired, of both
simultaneously. Their experiments have been crowned with
complete success, and, as the gun uses no more gas than
would be consumed if a flashing light system were used, the
cost of operation is very low.</p>

<p>The general features of the acetylene fog-gun may be observed
from the illustration (facing p. <a href="#ip_64">64</a>). The acetylene,
dissolved in acetone, is contained under pressure in a cylinder,
and thence passes through a reducing valve to an annular
space, where it is ignited by an electric spark. A trumpet
is attached to the firing chamber, so that the sound becomes
intensified. If desired, the explosion can be effected at the
burner, so that, in addition to a sound-signal, a flashing light
is given.</p>

<p>The applications vary according to the circumstances.
Suppose there is an unlighted bell-buoy at the bar of a port.
Here the procedure is to install a gun and light combined,
so that the flash of the explosion may give visual and the
report audible warning. Or, should there be a lighted buoy
already in position, its effectiveness may be enhanced by
adding the gun, the detonation alone being employed for
warning purposes. The size of the cylinder containing the
dissolved acetylene may be varied, so that renewal need
only be carried out once in one, two, or more months, according
to conditions. If the increasing traffic around a
certain rock demand that the latter should be marked, a
combined sound and light apparatus can be installed. It
may be that the head of a pier which is accessible only at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
certain times, or a beacon which can be reached only at
rare intervals, may require improved facilities. In this
case the gun can be set up and a cable laid to a convenient
spot which may be approached at all times by an attendant.
Then the latter, by the movement of a switch, can bring
the gun instantly into action upon the alarm of fog, and it
will keep firing at the set intervals until, the fog lifting, the
gun is switched off.</p>

<p>In some cases, where the apparatus is set upon a lonely
rock, a submarine cable may be laid between the marked
point and the control-station. The cable is not a very
costly addition. There are many lights where wages have
to be paid merely for a man to bring the fog-signalling bell
machinery into action. In such cases a fog-gun can be installed
and the annual cost of maintenance decreased
enormously, thereby enabling the outlay on the gun to be
recouped within a very short time; while the light may be
improved by using the flashes, so that the warning can be
rendered more distinctive.</p>

<p>The invention is also applicable to lightships, many of
which are manned by four men or more at a large cost per
annum. In the majority of cases an unattended Stevenson
lightship&mdash;such as described in another chapter, six of which
are in use around the coasts of Scotland, and which give, not
only a first-class light, but, by the aid of the fog-signal gun,
can be made to give an excellent fog-signal as well&mdash;offers a
means of reducing the heavy maintenance charges arising
in connection with a manned light-vessel. In many instances
existing lightships can be converted to the automatic
system and completed by the gun. Each case must,
of course, be decided upon its merits as regards the time
the gun and light are required to work upon a single charge
of acetylene, but there are no insuperable obstacles to its
utilization.</p>

<p>Of course, in an isolated station lying perhaps some miles
off the mainland, it may be necessary to keep the gun going
night and day in fog and in clear weather alike. In this
case, naturally, the great number of explosions involves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
considerable expense; but the inventors are carrying out
experiments with a view to switching the gun on and off, as
required, from a distant point by means of wireless telegraphy,
so as to effect a saving in the expenditure of acetylene
when there is no need on account of fine weather to
keep the gun going. Still, it must not be supposed that
the detonations even during clear weather are altogether
abortive, inasmuch as a sound-signal at sea, where the
atmosphere has a long-distance-carrying capacity as a rule,
in conjunction with a light, draws double attention to a
danger spot. Under such circumstances the waste of
acetylene gas during periods of clear weather is more
apparent than real.</p>

<p>The contest against the elements is still being waged,
and slowly but surely engineering science is improving its
position, and is hopeful of rendering audible signals as completely
effective as those of a visual character.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is doubtful whether the name of any lighthouse is so
familiar throughout the English-speaking world as the
“Eddystone.” Certainly no other “pillar of fire by night,
of cloud by day,” can offer so romantic a story of dogged
engineering perseverance, of heartrending disappointments,
disaster, blasted hopes, and brilliant success.</p>

<p>Standing out in the English Channel, about sixty miles
east of the Lizard, is a straggling ridge of rocks which
stretches for hundreds of yards across the marine thoroughfare,
and also obstructs the western approach to Plymouth
Harbour. But at a point some nine and a half miles south
of Rame Head, on the mainland, the reef rises somewhat
abruptly to the surface, so that at low-water two or three
ugly granite knots are bared, which tell only too poignantly
the complete destruction they could wreak upon a vessel
which had the temerity or the ill luck to scrape over them
at high-tide. Even in the calmest weather the sea curls
and eddies viciously around these stones; hence the name
“Eddystones” is derived.</p>

<p>From the days when trading vessels first used the English
Channel the reef has been a spot of evil fame. How many
ships escaped the perils and dangers of the seven seas only
to come to grief on this ridge within sight of home, or how
many lives have been lost upon it, will never be known.
Only the more staggering holocausts, such as the wreck of
the <i>Winchelsea</i>, stand out prominently in the annals of
history, but these serve to emphasize the terrible character
of the menace offered. The port of Plymouth, as may be
supposed, suffered with especial severity.</p>

<p>As British overseas traffic expanded, the idea of indicating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the spot for the benefit of vessels was discussed. The
first practical suggestion was put forward about the year
1664, but thirty-two years elapsed before any attempt was
made to reduce theory to practice. Then an eccentric
English country gentleman, Henry Winstanley, who dabbled
in mechanical engineering upon unorthodox lines, came forward
and offered to build a lighthouse upon the terrible
rock. Those who knew this ambitious amateur were dubious
of his success, and wondered what manifestation his eccentricity
would assume on this occasion. Nor was their scepticism
entirely misplaced. Winstanley raised the most
fantastic lighthouse which has ever been known, and which
would have been more at home in a Chinese cemetery than
in the English Channel. It was wrought in wood and most
lavishly embellished with carvings and gilding.</p>

<p>Four years were occupied in its construction, and the
tower was anchored to the rock by means of long, heavy
irons. The light, merely a flicker, flashed out from this
tower in 1699 and for the first time the proximity of the
Eddystones was indicated all round the horizon by night.
Winstanley’s critics were rather free in expressing their
opinion that the tower would come down with the first
sou’-wester, but the eccentric builder was so intensely
proud of his achievement as to venture the statement that
it would resist the fiercest gale that ever blew, and, when
such did occur, he hoped that he might be in the tower at
the time.</p>

<p>Fate gratified his wish, for while he was on the rock in
the year 1703 one of the most terrible tempests that ever
have assailed the coasts of Britain gripped the structure,
tore it up by the roots, and hurled it into the Channel,
where it was battered to pieces, its designer and five keepers
going down with the wreck. When the inhabitants of
Plymouth, having vainly scanned the horizon for a sign
of the tower on the following morning, put off to the rock
to investigate, they found only the bent and twisted iron
rods by which the tower had been held in position projecting
mournfully into the air from the rock-face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Shortly after the demolition of the tower, the reef, as if
enraged at having been denied a number of victims owing
to the existence of the warning light, trapped the <i>Winchelsea</i>
as she was swinging up Channel, and smashed her to
atoms, with enormous loss of life.</p>

<p>Although the first attempt to conquer the Eddystone had
terminated so disastrously, it was not long before another
effort was made to mark the reef. The builder this time
was a Cornish labourer’s son, John Rudyerd, who had
established himself in business on Ludgate Hill as a silk-mercer.
In his youth he had studied civil engineering, but
his friends had small opinion of his abilities in this craft.
However, he attacked the problem boldly, and, although his
tower was a plain, business-looking structure, it would have
been impossible to conceive a design capable of meeting the
peculiar requirements of the situation more efficiently. It
was a cone, wrought in timber, built upon a stone and wood
foundation anchored to the rock, and of great weight and
strength. The top of the cone was cut off to permit the
lantern to be set in position. The result was that externally
the tower resembled the trunk of an oak-tree, and appeared
to be just about as strong. It offered the minimum of
resistance to the waves, which, tumbling upon the ledge,
rose and curled around the tapering form without starting
a timber.</p>

<p>Rudyerd, indeed, may be considered to be the father of
the science of modern lighthouse designing, because the
lines that he evolved have never been superseded for exposed
positions even in these days of advanced engineering
science, greater constructional facilities, and improved
materials. Rudyerd’s ingenuity and skill received a triumphant
vindication when the American engineers set out to
build the Minot’s Ledge and Spectacle Reef lighthouses,
inasmuch as these men followed slavishly in the lines he
laid down, and their achievements are numbered among the
great lighthouses of the world to-day.</p>

<p>Rudyerd built his tower with infinite care, although he
was harassed in his operations by the depredations of French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
privateers, who haunted this part of the British coast. On
one occasion the whole of the men were surprised while at
their work, and were borne off in triumph as prisoners of
war to France. Louis XIV., however, heard of the capture,
and the privateers, instead of being honoured for the catch,
as they anticipated, were strongly reprimanded and compelled
to release their captures. “Their work is for the
benefit of all nations. I am at war with England, not with
humanity,” was the Sovereign’s comment; and by way of
compensation the prisoners were loaded with presents and
reconveyed to the rock, to resume their toil.</p>

<p>For forty years Rudyerd’s structure defied the elements,
and probably would have been standing to this day had it
not possessed one weak point. It was built of wood instead
of stone. Consequently, when a fire broke out in the
lantern on December 4, 1755, the flames, fanned by the
breeze, rapidly made their way downwards. The keepers
were impotent and sought what refuge they could find
under projecting crags below, as the lead which had been
employed in construction melted into drops and rained
down on all sides, so that the unfortunate men were exposed
to another and more alarming danger. In fact, one man,
while watching the progress of the fire, was drenched with
a shower of molten metal, some of which, he declared, had
entered his open mouth and had penetrated into his stomach.
When rescued he was writhing in fearful agony, but his
story was received with incredulity, his comrades believing
that the experience had turned his brain and that this was
merely one of his delusions. When the man died, a post-mortem
examination was made, and the doctors discovered
ample corroboration of the man’s story in the form of a lump
of lead weighing some seven ounces!</p>

<p>No time was lost in erecting another tower on the rock,
for now it was more imperative than ever that the reef
should be lighted adequately. The third engineer was John
Smeaton, who first landed on the rock to make the surveys
on April 5, 1756. He was able to stay there for only two
and a quarter hours before the rising tide drove him off,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
but in that brief period he had completed the work necessary
to the preparation of his design. Wood had succumbed to
the attacks of tempest and of fire in turn. He would use a
material which would defy both&mdash;Portland stone. He also
introduced a slight change in the design for such structures,
and one which has been universally copied, producing the
graceful form of lighthouse with which everyone is so
familiar. Instead of causing the sides to slope upwards in
the straight lines of a cone, such as Rudyerd adopted,
Smeaton preferred a slightly concave curve, so that the
tower was given a waist at about half its height. He also
selected the oak-tree as his guide, but one having an extensive
spread of branches, wherein will be found a shape in the
trunk, so far as the broad lines are concerned, which coincides
with the form of Smeaton’s lighthouse. He chose a
foundation where the rock shelved gradually to its highest
point, and dropped vertically into the water upon the opposite
side. The face of the rock was roughly trimmed to
permit the foundation-stones of the tower to be laid. The
base of the building was perfectly solid to the entrance
level, and each stone was dovetailed securely into its
neighbour.</p>

<p class="captionc">To the right is the stump of Smeaton’s historic tower.</p></div></div>

<p>From the entrance, which was about 15 feet above high-water,
a central well, some 5 feet in diameter, containing a
staircase, led to the storeroom, nearly 30 feet above high-water.
Above this was a second storeroom, a living-room
as the third floor, and the bedroom beneath the lantern.
The light was placed about 72 feet above high-water, and
comprised a candelabra having two rings, one smaller than,
and placed within, the other, but raised about a foot above
its level, the two being held firmly in position by means of
chains suspended from the roof and secured to the floor.
The rings were adapted to receive twenty-four lights, each
candle weighing about 2¾ ounces. Even candle manufacture
was in its infancy in those days, and periodically the
keepers had to enter the lantern to snuff the wicks. In
order to keep the watchers of the lights on the alert, Smeaton
installed a clock of the grandfather pattern in the tower,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and fitted it with a gong, which struck every half-hour to
apprise the men of these duties. This clock is now one
of the most interesting relics in the museum at Trinity
House.</p>

<p>The first stone of the tower was laid on a Sunday in June,
1757, as the date on the block indicates; and although work
had to be pursued fitfully and for only a few hours at a time
between the tides, in the early stages, Smeaton seized every
opportunity offered by the wind and sea to push the task
forward. For four years the men slaved upon the rock, and,
although the mechanical handling appliances of those days
were primitive, the tower was completed without a single
mishap. The solidity of the structure, and its lines, which,
as the engineer stated, would offer the minimum of resistance
to the Atlantic rollers, but at the same time would insure
the utmost stability, aroused widespread admiration, for
it was felt that the engineer had triumphed over Nature at
last. Many people expressed a desire to see how the tower
would weather such a storm as carried away Winstanley’s
freakish building, especially as, in a roaring sou’-wester,
the waves hurled themselves upon the ledge to wreathe and
curl upwards to a point far above the dome, blotting the
light from sight. The supreme test came in 1762, when the
lighthouse was subjected to a battering and pounding far
heavier than any that it had previously known. But the
tower emerged from this ordeal unscathed, and Smeaton’s
work was accepted as invulnerable.</p>

<p>A THRILLING EXPERIENCE.</p>

<p class="captionc">Landing upon the Eddystone by the crane rope during a rough sea.</p></div></div>

<p>The lighthouse had been standing for 120 years, when
ominous reports were received by the Trinity Brethren
concerning the stability of the tower. The keepers stated
that during severe storms the building shook alarmingly.
A minute inspection of the structure was made, and it was
found that, although the work of Smeaton’s masons was
above reproach, time and weather had left their mark.
The tower was becoming decrepit. The binding cement
had decayed, and the air imprisoned and compressed within
the interstices by the waves was disintegrating the structure
slowly but surely. While there was no occasion to apprehend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
a sudden collapse, still it was considered advisable to
take precautionary measures in time. Unfortunately, it
was not feasible to strengthen Smeaton’s tower so adequately
as to give it a new lease of life, while lighthouse
engineering had made rapid strides in certain details since
it was completed. Another factor to be considered was
the desire for a more elevated light, capable of throwing its
rays to a greater distance.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was decided to build a new
tower on another convenient ledge, forming part of the
main reef, about 120 feet distant. Sir James Douglass, the
Engineer-in-Chief to Trinity House, completed the designs
and personally superintended their execution. The Smeaton
lines were taken as a basis, with one important exception.
Instead of the curve commencing at the foundations, the
latter comprised a perfect cylindrical monolith of masonry
22 feet in height by 44 feet in diameter. From this base the
tower springs to a height which brings the focal plane
130 feet above the highest spring-tides. The top of the
base is 30 inches above high-water, and the tower’s diameter
at this point being less than that of its plinth, the set-off
forms an excellent landing-stage when the weather permits.</p>

<p>The site selected for the Douglass tower being lower than
that chosen by Smeaton, the initial work was more exacting,
as the duration of the working period was reduced. The
rock, being gneiss, was extremely tough, and the preliminary
quarrying operations for the foundation-stones which had
to be sunk into the rock were tedious and difficult, especially
as the working area was limited. Each stone was dovetailed,
not only to its neighbour on either side, but below
and above as well. The foundation-stones were dovetailed
into the reef, and were secured still further by the aid of
two bolts, each 1½ inches in diameter, which were passed
through the stone and sunk deeply into the rock below.
The exposed position of the reef enabled work to be continued
only fitfully during the calmest weather, for often when
wind and sea were quiet the rock was inaccessible owing to
the swell. Upon the approach of bad weather everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
was made fast under the direct supervision of the engineer&mdash;a
man who took no chances.</p>

<p>From the set-off the tower is solid to a height of 25½ feet,
except for two fresh-water tanks sunk in the floor of the
entrance-room, which hold 4,700 gallons. At this point
the walls are no less than 8½ feet thick, and the heavy teak
door is protected by an outer door of gun-metal, weighing
a ton, both of which are closed during rough weather.</p>

<p>The tower has eight floors, exclusive of the entrance;
there are two oilrooms, one above the other, holding
4,300 gallons of oil, above which is a coal and store room,
followed by a second storeroom. Outside the tower at
this level is a crane, by which supplies are hoisted, and which
also facilitates the landing and embarkation of the keepers,
who are swung through the air in a stirrup attached to the
crane rope. Then in turn come the living-room, the “low-light”
room, bedroom, service-room, and finally the lantern.
For the erection of the tower, 2,171 blocks of granite,
which were previously fitted temporarily in their respective
positions on shore, and none of which weighed less than
2 tons, were used. When the work was commenced, the
engineer estimated that the task would occupy five years,
but on May 18, 1882, the lamp was lighted by the Duke
of Edinburgh, the Master of Trinity House at the time, the
enterprise having occupied only four years. Some idea may
thus be obtained of the energy with which the labour was
pressed forward, once the most trying sections were overcome.</p>

<p>Whereas the former lights on this rock had been of the
fixed type, a distinctive double flash was now introduced.
The optical apparatus is of the biform dioptric type, emitting
a beam of some 300,000 candle-power intensity, which is
visible for seventeen miles. In addition to this measure of
warning, two powerful Argand burners, with reflectors, were
set up in the low-light room for the purpose of throwing a
fixed ray from a point 40 feet below the main flashing beam,
to mark a dangerous reef lying 3½ miles to the north-west,
known as Hand Deeps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
When the new tower was completed and brought into
service, the Smeaton building was demolished. This task
was carried out with extreme care, inasmuch as the citizens
of Plymouth had requested that the historic Eddystone
structure might be re-erected on Plymouth Hoe, on the
spot occupied by the existing Trinity House landmark.
The authorities agreed to this proposal, and the ownership
of the Smeaton tower was forthwith transferred to the
people of Plymouth. But demolition was carried out only
to the level of Smeaton’s lower storeroom. The staircase,
well and entrance were filled up with masonry, the top was
bevelled off, and in the centre of the stump an iron pole was
planted. While the Plymouth Hoe relic is but one half of
the tower, its re-erection was completed faithfully, and,
moreover, carries the original candelabra which the famous
engineer devised.</p>

<p>Not only is the Douglass tower a beautiful example of
lighthouse engineering, but it was relatively cheap. The
engineer, when he prepared the designs, estimated that an
outlay of £78,000, or $390,000, would be incurred. As a
matter of fact, the building cost only £59,255, or $296,275,
and a saving of £18,000, or $90,000, in a work of this magnitude
is no mean achievement. All things considered, the
Eddystone is one of the cheapest sea-rock lights which has
ever been consummated.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME FAMOUS LIGHTS OF ENGLAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The captain of the lordly liner, as he swings down Channel
or approaches the English coast from the broad Atlantic,
maintains a vigilant watch until the light or the slender
proportions of the lonely outpost rising apparently from the
ocean’s depths off the south-west corner of the Scilly Islands,
become visible. This is the Bishop Rock, the western sentinel
of the English Channel, mounting guard over as wicked a
stretch of sea as may be found anywhere between the two
Poles, where the maritime traffic is densest and where
wrecks, unfortunately, are only too frequent; for the toll
levied by the sea off the Cornish coast is fearful.</p>

<p>Among these islands was planted one of the first beacons
erected off the British coasts. At the outset it was merely
a wood bonfire, then a brazier, and finally a lighthouse,
which crowned St. Agnes’s height, to guide the mariner on
his way. But to-day the St. Agnes light is no more than a
memory. Two or three years ago the keepers quenched the
light in the misty grey of the dawn for the last time. The
vigil which had been maintained over shipping uninterruptedly
through some 230 years was ended. On a neighbouring
point a superior modern light had been planted which took
up the sacred duty. Although established in 1680, the
St. Agnes was not the oldest light in England. This distinction
belongs to the North Foreland light on the East
Kentish coast, which was set going as far back as 1636.
This warning was shed from a tower of timber, lath, and
plaster, built by Sir John Meldrum, but it fell a victim to
fire forty-seven years later. The light was reconstructed
promptly, and to-day throws a red and white gleam of 35,000
candle-power, which may be picked up twenty miles away.</p>

<p>THE “BISHOP,” THE WESTERN OUTPOST OF ENGLAND.</p>

<p class="captionc">This tower marks a treacherous reef, rising from the depths of the Atlantic off the Scilly Islands. Its slim proportions are familiar to
Transatlantic passengers.</p></div></div>

<p>The south-western extremity of England, however, is far
more to be dreaded than the south-eastern. Here Nature
mixed land and water in an inextricable maze during her
moulding process. Deep, tortuous, wide channels separate
rugged granite islets, while long, ugly ridges creep stealthily
out to sea beneath the pall of water, ready to trap the unsuspecting
vessel which ventures too closely. If one were
to take a map of this part of the country, were to dig one
leg of a compass into the Lizard Head, stretching the other
so as to reach the Eddystone light, and then were to describe
a circle, the enclosed space would contain more famous sea-rock
lights than a similar area on any other part of the
globe. Within its circumference there would be the Eddystone,
Bishop Rock, Wolf, and Longships, each of which
lifts its cupola above a wave-swept ledge of rocks.</p>

<p>The need for an adequate indication of the Scillies was
felt long before the Eddystone gained its ill fame. These
scattered masses of granite, numbering about 140 in all,
break up the expanse of the Atlantic about twenty miles
south-west of the Cornish mainland. Now, the maritime
traffic flowing in and out of the English Channel is divided
into two broad classes&mdash;the coastal and the oversea trade
respectively. The former is able to creep through the dangerous
channel separating the Scillies from the mainland,
but the latter has to make a détour to the south. One
fringe of the broken cluster is as dangerous as the other,
so that both streams of trade demand protection.</p>

<p>On the south side the knots dot the sea in all directions.
They are mere black specks, many only revealing themselves
at lowest tides; others do not betray their existence
even then. The outermost ledge is the Bishop Rock, where
disasters have been fearful and numerous. One of the most
terrible catastrophes on record happened here, when three
vessels of Sir Cloudesley Shovel’s fleet went to pieces in the
year 1707, and dragged 2,000 men down with them, including
the Admiral himself. In more recent times, some
two or three years ago, the Atlantic transport liner <i>Minnehaha</i>
dragged her lumbering body over the selfsame attenuated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
rampart, and was badly damaged before she could be
rescued. As may be supposed, in days gone by the awful
character of the coast brought prosperity to the inhabitants
of Cornwall, who reaped rich harvests from the inhuman
practice of wrecking, in which horrible work the Scilly
Islanders were easily pre-eminent and more successful, since
they held the outer lines upon which the majority of ships
came to grief.</p>

<p>In the forties of last century it was decided that this
graveyard should be marked, but there was one great difficulty.
This was the exposure of the low-lying rock to some
4,000 miles of open Atlantic, where the rollers rise and fall
with a force that turns the waters for miles around into a
seething maelstrom of foam and surf. The aspect presented
at this spot during a stiff south-westerly or westerly gale is
terrifying in the extreme, and it is not surprising that
approaching vessels stand so far off that the tower is often
barely discernible against the background of cloud and
banks of mist caused by the spray hurled into the air from
the breakers smashing on the rocks.</p>

<p>THE WOLF ROCK LIGHTHOUSE.</p>

<p class="captionc">One of the famous lights of England. Owing to the rocks being exposed to the full fury of the Atlantic, its erection was attended with
prodigious difficulty.</p></div></div>

<p>When it was proposed to build a lighthouse upon a crag
in the heart of this vortex, many people who knew the
neighbourhood shook their heads doubtfully. The ledge
was so small, the force of the elements so powerful, that it
appeared to be tempting Fate unduly to attempt the erection
of a slim stalk of stonework thereon. Some records of the
wind pressure exerted during the heaviest tempests were
taken, and they showed that the pressure of the wind at
times exceeded 7,000 pounds per square foot. It was
decided to provide a structure which should offer the minimum
of resistance to the waves. This assumed the form
of the iron screw-pile tower so common in American waters.
The legs were cast-iron tubes sunk into the solid granite,
braced and stayed by means of wrought-iron rods. The
engineers maintained that the waves would be able to roll
unrestrainedly among the piles, instead of being obstructed,
so that the skeleton building would escape the heavy
buffetings which solid masonry would experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
But engineering science proved woefully frail when pitted
against the unharnessed forces of Nature. A heavy gale
sprang up one night; the waves rose and fell upon the stilts,
broke them up like reeds, and carried away the whole of the
superstructure. The following low-tide revealed only a few
short lengths of broken and bent tubes, around which the
waves bubbled and hissed as if in triumph at their victory.
Thus ended the first attempt to provide the Bishop Rock
with a lighthouse.</p>

<p>The engineer, though defeated, was not dismayed. As
a skeleton structure was impotent, he would erect a massive
masonry tower which not all the force of the waves could
avail to demolish. Although the reef is about 150 feet in
length by 52 feet in width, the engineer, James Walker,
was not afforded much space upon which to place his creation.
He reconnoitred the ridge, and finally chose a small
lump just sufficiently large upon which to effect a foothold.
The Smeaton type of tower was his model, and the surface
of the rock was trimmed to receive the first blocks.
This was the greatest difficulty. Unless the sea were as
smooth as a millpond, he was helpless, as the lowest blocks
had to be laid a foot beneath low-water mark. A heavy
cofferdam was erected around the site, and the water within
was pumped out, so that the masons might be able to toil
upon a dry rock-face.</p>

<p>The exposed, isolated character of the spot rendered the
housing of the workmen a problem in itself. They could
not be accommodated on the site; a temporary dwelling
on piles for their accommodation could not be established,
as it would come down with the first gale, and housing on
a tender was equally impracticable. There was a small
uninhabited islet within convenient distance of the reef,
and on this the living-quarters and workshops were erected,
the men being transported to and fro whenever the conditions
were suitable. Traces of this bygone industrial
activity still remain on the island, but the sea-fowl have
once more claimed it exclusively as their home. The
working spells were brief, as well as being somewhat few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
and far between, while the base was being prepared. The
granite was brought to the island depot, fashioned into
shape, and then sent to the Bishop for erection. Granite
was used exclusively, and in 1878, after seven years’ arduous
labour, the tower, 120 feet in height, capped by a powerful
light, was completed: the dreaded Bishop Rock was conquered
at last.</p>

<p>When it was first commissioned, four men were deputed
to watch this light, three being on the rock, and the fourth man
on leave at St. Mary’s. The duty was for three months continuous,
one man being relieved every month if possible; but,
as a matter of fact, the spell on the rock often was increased,
owing to the weather rendering it impossible to exchange
the men. The character of their duty, under the terrible
assaults of the sea, played havoc with the constitutions and
nerves of the lighthouse-keepers. They became taciturn,
and inevitably fell victims to neurasthenia, owing to their
long periods of isolation. Accordingly the authorities
gradually relaxed the spell of duty, until now it
comprises a month on the rock, followed by a fortnight
ashore, while six men, instead of four, are appointed to
the station. The Bishop light demands watchers of iron
constitution and prolonged experience of the rigours of
imprisonment upon a lonely rock. The men appear to
suffer most from the fear that one day the seas will regain
the upper hand and carry the slender-looking shaft of
masonry away. When the Atlantic is roused to fury, the
din created by the waves smashing against the tower and
reef is so deafening that the keepers can only converse by
signs.</p>

<p>The attacks which this tower has to withstand are fearful.
When the equinoxes are raging, it is no uncommon circumstance
for the waves to roll up the side of the tower and
hurl themselves clean over the lantern. The enormous
force of the water was brought home very startlingly to
the attendants of the light one night, when a more than
usually wicked breaker slid up the curved round face and
wrenched the fog-bell, weighing 550 pounds, from its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
fastenings on the lantern gallery. The ponderous piece of
metal was dashed on to the reef and smashed to fragments.
A small piece was recovered after the gale, and is now
preserved in the Trinity House museum as an interesting
memento of the night when the Atlantic almost got the
upper hand. The nerves of the men are tried severely, also,
by memories of the terrible marine disasters which have
happened on or near the ridge, such as that of the German
packet <i>Schiller</i>, which went down in 1875 with the loss of
331 lives.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the ceaseless attacks of the waves
should have left their traces at last. The light had been
burning for about twenty years, when tremors and quakings,
similar to those observed in connection with Smeaton’s
Eddystone tower, were reported to the authorities. Sir
James Douglass visited the rock, and made a minute inspection.
It was apparent that the lighthouse demanded extensive
overhauling and strengthening if it were to be preserved.
In fact, this was the only feasible course of action,
as there was not another suitable spot whereon a new structure
could be raised. The Eddystone had been completed,
and as the same tackle was available, the protective work
was undertaken at once. In conjunction with this enterprise,
the engineer also advocated an increase in the height of the
tower.</p>

<p>His plans met with approval, and an ingenious means of
strengthening the existing building was evolved. Virtually
it comprised the erection of a new tower around the old
shaft, and connected to the latter, so as to form one homogeneous
structure. In order to strengthen the foundations,
massive blocks of masonry were sunk into the rock, cemented,
and held in position by heavy bolts. From the
masons’ point of view, the task of overhauling was more
exciting and dangerous than that which had attended the
erection of the original tower; for the men had to toil on
narrow, swinging platforms, cutting notches in the face of
every stone in the existing structure to receive dovetails on
the blocks of the new outer shell. Thus the latter were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
dovetailed to adjacent blocks on five out of their six faces.
A massive chain was slung round the upper part of the tower,
from which life-lines hung down to the men working below.
A man was stationed as a lookout. When he saw a breaker
approaching he gave a signal; each man clutched his life-rope
tenaciously and retained his foothold as best he could
on his perilous perch while the water swept over him.
Often the men were submerged by a rushing wave, and
when the water subsided shook themselves like dogs emerging
from the water. But the provision of the life-ropes prevented
serious injury and loss of life, although the masons
at times were considerably knocked about.</p>

<p>The tower has been given an enormous, massive, cylindrical
base, while the shaft is solid to the entrance level,
except for the usual water-tanks. The attachment of the
outer shell reinforced it remarkably, the walls at the entrance
being increased to a thickness of 8 feet. The addition of
the four extra floors elevated the light by a further 40 feet,
the focal plane now being 163 feet above high-water. The
light, of 622,500 candle-power, visible for eighteen miles,
is a white group-flash, there being two flashes, each of four
seconds’ duration, with an intervening eclipse of five seconds,
while the groups are separated by intervals of forty-seven
seconds.</p>

<p>Off the northern shores of the Scillies, standing in the
strait which provides a short-cut around the toe of England,
is another magnificent tower. This is the Wolf Rock
lighthouse, marking the reef of that name, which lies eight
miles off Land’s End in the fairway of the coastal traffic.
The cluster of rocks from which it rises is just as dangerous
as that to the south, and is exposed likewise to the full fury
of the south-westerly gales coming in from the Atlantic.
It was one of the most attractive spots to the old Cornish
wreckers, for ships which lost their way during the fogs
which hang about this coast invariably blundered into the
reef, to be smashed to pieces within a very short time.</p>

<p>This spot was not so greatly feared by the seafarer when
heavy gales prevailed. There was a hollow rock on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
ridge, into which the waves were driven. In so doing they
compressed the air within the space, which, as it escaped,
produced a long, distinctive wail, recalling the cry of the
wolf. It was this natural phenomenon which gave the
rock its name. The harder the wind blew, and the higher
the waves rose, the louder was the reverberating bellow,
and, as it could be heard distinctly above the music of the
storm, the navigator was able to steer clear of the formidable
obstruction. On the other hand, during periods of heavy
fog, when the waves were usually quiet, there was scarcely
any perceptible sound.</p>

<p>THE LONGSHIPS LIGHT.</p>

<p class="captionc">In the background is the forbidding iron-bound Cornish coast, where wrecks unfortunately are frequent.</p></div></div>

<p>The Wolf Rock would be growling to this day had it not
been for the inhuman action of the Cornish plunderers.
They detested the weird noise as cordially as the mariner
blessed it. It robbed them of so many rich hauls that at
last they decided to silence the rock for ever. They filled
the cavity with large boulders, which were carried out in
boats from the mainland and dumped overboard. Then
the Cornishmen met with a spell of enhanced prosperity
from the increased number of wrecks which occurred.</p>

<p>When the exigencies of commerce demanded that the
reef should be guarded, a most fantastic device was prepared.
An attempt was made to restore artificially the natural
siren. A fabric wrought in copper in the form of a huge
wolf with distended jaws was contrived, the designers
averring that the air would rush in and produce a distinctive
whistle. This grotesque danger-signal never reached its
destination. It would have been absolutely useless even
had it been placed over the rock, as the first lively sea would
have carried it away, while the noise produced, if any, would
have been inaudible more than a few feet away.</p>

<p>The Trinity Brethren at last took the matter up, but their
investigations caused them to doubt the possibility of building
a lighthouse on such a forbidding spot. They did the next
best thing. They drove a thick oak joist into the rock, and
attached a coloured sphere to its upper extremity. This
constituted a valuable landmark by day, but was useless at
night. But its life was brief. The first storm which swept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
the reef after the erection of the beacon tore it up by the
roots. It was replaced by a heavy mast of wrought-iron,
which suffered a similar fate, as did also a third iron pole
9 inches in diameter. At last a low conical stump was built
upon the ridge, with the staff and sphere projecting from
its centre. This defied wind and wave successfully for many
years. Its permanency impressed the builders of the Bishop
Rock light, who came to the conclusion that, as the small
conical tower held hard and fast, a masonry tower could
be given just as firm a hold.</p>

<p>When the engineer approached the reef to make his
surveys, he found the water boiling and bubbling madly,
and it was some time before he could get a foothold. He
completed his examination, and then found, to his dismay,
that the boat could not approach to take him off. He could
not stay where he was, as the tide, which was rising, would
engulf the reef within a short time, so he resorted to a bold
expedient. He had taken the precaution to bring a life-line
with him, so that he was in touch with the boat. He
looped this round his waist securely, and then, telling the
men to pull as hard as they could, he plunged into the water.
In this manner he was dragged through the furious surf
and pulled into the boat, thoroughly drenched, but otherwise
none the worse for his adventure.</p>

<p>THE GODREVY LIGHT, SCILLY ISLANDS.</p>

<p class="captionc">It marks a forbidding clump of rocks, landing on which is always exciting.</p></div></div>

<p>The work was begun in 1862, when the masons were
despatched to the rock to prepare the face for the reception
of the bottom masonry blocks. The tedious and exceptionally
dangerous character of the work was emphasized very
forcibly upon those engaged in the task. It was seldom
that the water was sufficiently placid to enable a landing to
be made. Then, as the working spell was very brief, being
restricted to low-tide, the men could pause only for a few
minutes at a time, and even during these were menaced by
the breakers. During the first working season only eighty-three
hours of labour were possible&mdash;a fact which conveys
a graphic idea of the exposed character of the site, its difficulty
of access, and the short time available for work between
the tides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
While excavations were under way, the preparation of a
landing-stage was taken in hand. As only small blocks of
stone could be used, naturally it occupied a considerable time.
It was, however, essential, in order to permit the erection
of a derrick by which the heavy blocks for the tower could
be lifted from the construction boat to the rock. On the
rock-face itself the masons toiled strenuously, chipping,
scraping, and paring away all the faulty pieces of gneiss,
so that a firm, solid foundation was secured, into which the
bottom course of stones was dovetailed and anchored.</p>

<p>Owing to the frequency with which the rock was swept
by the seas, special precautions had to be adopted to insure
the safety of the workmen. Iron dogs were driven into the rock
at frequent points, to which ropes were fastened and allowed
to trail across the rock, each mason being urged to keep one
of these life-lines always within arm’s length. As an additional
precaution he was compelled to wear a lifebelt,
which, although it hampered free movement somewhat,
yet gave the wearer, if he lost his foothold or were thrown
into the water, a chance of keeping afloat until the lifeboat
standing by was able to reach him. A Cornish fisherman,
who was familiar with the seas on this part of the coast,
and who could judge a breaking wave from a distance,
acted as a lookout. When he saw a comber about to creep
over the rock, he gave a signal, when the workmen clutched
their life-lines, and, with feet firmly planted and the ropes
drawn taut, or throwing themselves prostrate, with heads
pointed to the advancing wave, allowed the breaker to roll
over them and expend its violence harmlessly. Time after
time the masons were buried beneath huge tumbling hills
of water. Work under such conditions was decidedly irksome,
and progress was very appreciably retarded, but
the safety of the workmen was, of course, the pre-eminent
consideration. Curiously enough, these men who face the
perils, privations, and exciting incessant dangers, incidental
to lighthouse building, are extremely superstitious. If an
undertaking such as the Wolf were attended by a disaster
and loss of life in its initial stages, the completion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
task might be seriously jeopardized. The rock would be
regarded as a “hoo-doo,” and would be shunned like a
fever-stricken city. Therefore the engineer will go to any
lengths to secure, so far as is humanly possible, the preservation
of the lives and limbs of those in his employ. This is
the chief reason why the erection of these wonderful towers
has been attended by so few accidents or fatalities, while
the men fitted for the task are so few that the engineer cannot
afford to disturb their peace of mind.</p>

<p>The Wolf tower follows the generally accepted lines, and
is solid at the base. It is wrought throughout of granite,
the stones being joggled together. One ingenious measure
was adopted in connection with the lower courses in order
to prevent the action of the waves from breaking up the
cement in the exposed joints and setting up disintegration.
The upper surface of each stone is given a wide rabbet, and
the stone above fits into the recess so that the horizontal
joint between the two is covered by the outer fillet, thereby
protecting it completely. This practice was followed
throughout all the lower courses to a height of 39 feet, and
the security thus obtained is reflected by the strength of
the tower to-day after half a century’s wear.</p>

<p>Work proceeded so slowly in the early stages, owing to
the abnormal conditions, that by the end of 1864 only thirty-seven
stones in the second course of masonry were laid. In
the meantime, however, the landing-stage had been practically
completed, and the erection of the crane enabled the
blocks for the tower to be transferred to the rock with
greater ease and rapidity. The tower, 135 feet in height,
was completed on July 19, 1869, while the light was brought
into service early in the following year. Eight years were
expended upon the enterprise, and during this period 296
landings were effected upon the rock and 1,814 hours of
labour were consummated. This is equal to about 101
working days of ten hours each, or, on the average, less
than one hour every day of the years occupied in the undertaking.
The lantern throws a powerful white light, which
in clear weather may be seen from twenty to twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
miles away. The cost of the enterprise was £62,726, or
$313,630&mdash;nearly twice that of the first Bishop Rock light.</p>

<p>Another gaunt structure rears itself from a reef a few
miles to the north-west of the Wolf, and a short distance
off the Land’s End. This is the Longships light. The
name itself suggests a light-vessel, and a stranger is surprised
to learn that it is an imposing building, worthy of comparison
with the two other structures already described which guard
the Scillies. Although it is within a short distance of the
mainland, its exposed situation rendered its construction as
exasperatingly difficult as that of both the Bishop and Wolf
lights. A few miles farther north another powerful light
indicates the “Kingdom of Heaven,” as the black hump
of Lundy Island, rising out of the Bristol Channel, is colloquially
called, from the name of its clerical owner.</p>

<p>On the opposite side and due north of this bight, the Pembrokeshire
coast breaks off abruptly at St. David’s Head,
only to reappear out at sea in some twenty little rugged
islets known as The Smalls. They occur some twenty-one
miles off the mainland, and for years they played havoc
with the shipping plying between North of England ports
and the Bristol Channel. These rocks&mdash;for they are little
else&mdash;were the private property of a Liverpool gentleman,
who became so distracted by the frequency of disaster that,
in 1773, he decided to crown them with a beacon. He
selected a musical instrument manufacturer named Whiteside
as his engineer, and this amateur mechanic, after an
inspection, decided to place the warning light on a tiny crag
which projected about 5 feet above high-water. It is
somewhat strange that the adequate safeguarding of two
devastating parts of the south-western coast of England
should have been placed in the hands of men who were not
professional engineers. Rudyerd, the silk-mercer, was
responsible for the second Eddystone, and here was an
instrument-maker taking over one of the most difficult
enterprises it was possible to find. Yet both these amateur
engineers inscribed their names ineffaceably upon two of
the most evil spots around the coasts of the British Islands.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Rudyerd gave us the true conical design, which has never
been superseded for strength and stability; while Whiteside
evolved a skeleton tower which braved the most tempestuous
seas for some eighty years. In the first instance the
latter carried out his work in iron, thinking that metal would
prove irresistible, but within a short time he replaced it
with heavy legs of oak. The frail-looking structure was
submitted to storms of almost seismic violence, but it withstood
them all for over half a century, when a peculiarly
vicious wave, as it rolled between the supports, suddenly
flew upwards, driving the floor of the keepers’ quarters into
the roof. It was an exceptional accident, which no engineer
could have foreseen. When the Trinity House Brethren
took over the light, their chief engineer, Mr. James Walker,
looked upon the erection as such a fine piece of work that
the damage was repaired, and the Whiteside light gleamed
for a further twenty years before it gave place to the present
graceful stone building.</p>

<p>It was a grim episode at this light which brought about the
practice of appointing three men at least to a sea light-station.
When first completed, The Smalls was provided
with only two keepers, and on one occasion one of the two
died. His companion refrained from committing the body
to the sea, lest he might be suspected of foul-play, so he constructed
a rough shell, in which he placed the body of his
dead chum, and stood the grisly burden on end beside his
flag of distress on the gallery outside the lantern. As the
spell of duty in those days was four months, it was some
time before the relief came out. Then they discovered a
shattered human wreck tending the lights, who had never
neglected his duty under the onerous and weird conditions,
but who nevertheless had become broken down and aged
under the terrible ordeal. After this experience three men
instead of two were placed on duty at all such exposed and
inaccessible lights. It may be recalled that Alphonse
Daudet tells a similar creepy story which was related to him
by a light-keeper on the rugged Corsican coast, and which
he narrates in the “Phares des Sanguinaires.” A similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
experience is also associated with Rudyerd’s Eddystone
light.</p>

<p>Off the North Welsh coast there are the famous lights of
the South Stack and the Skerries, the latter rising out of the
water on a dangerous cluster of rocks off Carmel Head.
The Isle of Man also possesses a magnificent specimen of
lighthouse engineering in the Chicken Rock light, the work
of the brothers Stevenson, which, although in the Irish Sea,
comes within the jurisdiction of the Commissioners of
Northern Lights. This tower stands on a reef which is
submerged by 6 feet of water even at high neap-tides. When
a gale is raging and the spring-tides are at their highest,
the waves frequently engulf the lantern, although it is
perched 143 feet above the water. The light is of 143,000
candle-power, of the revolving type, and visible for sixteen
miles in clear weather.</p>

<p>Entering the English Channel from the Scillies, the
voyager observes the powerful Lizard light gleaming like two
brilliant white stars from a prominent elevated point on the
cliff. Formerly three lights were shown, but two were
found to meet the necessities of the situation adequately.
The steamship lane lies across the chord of the arc formed
by the coastline between the Lizard and Start Point, leaving
the Eddystone to the north. The next important light is
the Needles, at the entrance to the Solent. A few miles
farther on the brilliant spoke-light flashes of St. Catherine’s,
described in another chapter, compel attention. No other
light after this is seen until Beachy Head is approached.
Another dreary stretch brings the vessel abeam the nose of
Kentish coast known as Dungeness, a particularly notorious
danger spot. Here there is a continual struggle between
the engineers and the sea. While the waves gnaw into the
coastline at other neighbouring places, here they surrender
their capture, so that the headland is persistently creeping
farther and farther out to sea. It is lighted, and has been
guarded for years, but the tower is left at a constantly
increasing distance from the water’s edge. The light has
been moved once or twice, so as to fulfil its purpose to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
best advantage, but the engineer will be kept on the alert
until the currents change their courses and refrain from
piling up further drift at this point. This light, coming as
it does at the entrance to the bottle-neck of the English
Channel, is of prime importance to navigation, because
vessels, after they have rounded the South Foreland, make
a bee-line for this headland.</p>

<p>Since the eastern coast of England is flanked by sandbanks
and shoals, the lighthouse is not in powerful evidence,
the aids to navigation consisting chiefly of light-vessels,
which are distributed liberally so as to patrol completely a
treacherous stretch of shoals. Northwards the sandy, low-lying
wastes give way to towering cliffs, amongst which
Flamborough Head and its light are conspicuous. At the
far northern limit of the operations of Trinity House comes
the Longstones, mounting guard over the terrible Farne
Islands and their rocky outposts. Who has not heard of the
heroism of Grace Darling, the light-keeper’s daughter, and
the thrilling rescue, in the teeth of a hurricane, of the exhausted
survivors of the <i>Forfarshire</i>?</p>

<p>Complaints have been made often regarding the paucity
of powerful lights around the coast of England, but the
criticism scarcely is deserved. All the prominent and most
dangerous spots are lighted adequately, and, as may be
recognized, the provision of these lights has proved an
exacting and costly enterprise. What England may lack
in numbers in this particular field of engineering is compensated
for by the daring nature of the works completed,
which are regarded throughout the world as marvellous
achievements.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BELL ROCK AND SKERRYVORE LIGHTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At first sight it seems somewhat remarkable&mdash;some might
feel disposed to challenge the assertion&mdash;that so small a
country as Scotland should stand pre-eminent among the
nations of the world as being that possessed of the greatest
number of imposing sea-rock lights. But such is the case.
Moreover, North Britain offers some of the finest and most
impressive specimens of the lighthouse builder’s resource
and skill to be found in any part of the globe.</p>

<p>When the responsibility for lighting the Scottish coasts
was handed over to the Commissioners for Northern Lighthouses,
one of their first tasks was the adequate illumination
of the wave-swept Inchcape or Bell Rock, which lies some
twelve miles off the Scottish mainland in the busy portal
of the Firth of Tay. At that time this sinister menace to
navigation was not marked in any way whatever, and
apparently had remained in this unprotected condition ever
since the notorious pirate, Ralph the Rover, cut away the
buoy-bell which had been placed upon it by the Abbot of
Aberbrothock, as narrated in Southey’s famous ballad.</p>

<p>The rock, or rather reef&mdash;inasmuch as it measures
2,000 feet from end to end, and lies athwart the fairway&mdash;is
submerged completely to a depth of 16 feet at high spring-tides,
while at lowest water only some 4 feet of its crest
are laid bare here and there. This is not all. The ledge
is the summit of a dangerous, slowly-rising submarine
hillock, where, for a distance of about 100 yards on either
side, the lead sounds only 3 fathoms. Wrecks were so
numerous and terrible at this spot that the protection of the
seafaring community became imperative, and the newly-appointed
guardians of the Scottish coast lost no time in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
justifying the trust reposed in them, but erected a first-class
light. The Eddystone had been conquered, and, although
the conditions were dissimilar and the enterprise bolder, no
tangible reason against its imitation was advanced.</p>

<p>The engineer John Rennie was entrusted with the work,
while Robert Stevenson was appointed as his assistant.
The rock was surveyed, and a tower similar in its broad
lines to that evolved by Smeaton for the Eddystone was
elaborated, and the authority for its construction given in
the year 1806.</p>

<p>Work upon the rock in the earliest stages was confined
to the calmest days of the summer season, when the tides
were lowest, the water was smoothest, and the wind in its
calmest mood. Under such conditions the men were able
to stay on the site for about five hours. The engineer hoped
against hope that the elements would be kind to him, and
that he would be able to complete the preliminary work
upon the rock in one season.</p>

<p>The constructional plans were prepared carefully, so that
advantage might be taken of every promising opportunity.
One distinct drawback was the necessity to establish a
depot some distance from the erecting site. Those were the
days before steam navigation, and the capricious sailing
craft offered the only means of maintaining communication
between rock and shore, and for the conveyance of men
and material to and fro. The year 1807 was devoted to
the construction of vessels for the work, and to the establishment
of workshops with machinery and other facilities
at Arbroath, the nearest suitable point on the mainland to
the rock. A temporary beacon was placed on the reef, while
adjacent to the site selected for the tower a smith’s forge
was made fast, so as to withstand the dragging motion of
the waves when the rock was submerged. The men were
housed on the <i>Smeaton</i>, which during the spells of work on
the rock rode at anchor a short distance away in deep
water. The arrangements stipulated that three boats,
which were employed to bring the men from the vessel to
the rock, should always be moored at the landing-place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
so that, in the event of the weather changing for the worse,
the masons, forced to cease work suddenly, might regain
the <i>Smeaton</i> safely in one trip, the three boats being able to
convey thirty men, which constituted the average complement
on the rock.</p>

<p>While the preparations were proceeding ashore, a little
body of workers toiled, whenever possible, at clearing the
face of the rock and carrying out the requisite excavation
work. While this was in progress a disaster was averted
very narrowly, which would have jeopardized the completion
of the tower, owing to the superstitious natures of the men
engaged. On September 2, 1807, the <i>Smeaton</i>, as usual,
had brought out some thirty masons, had landed them
safely on the rock, and was riding at anchor.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wind freshened, and the engineer on the
rock grew apprehensive of the <i>Smeaton</i> dragging her cables.
A party at once put off from the rock in one of the three
boats and regained the ship, but were scarcely aboard when
the cables parted, and the vessel, caught by the wind and
tide, made off. Before the men regained control of her she
had drifted some three miles to leeward. Meantime on the
rock the situation was growing serious. Only Mr. Stevenson,
who was supervising operations on the spot, and the
landing-master were aware of its gravity. The masons
were so busy hewing, boring and chiselling, that they had
not noticed the <i>Smeaton’s</i> drift. But the engineer, observing
the flowing of the tide, realized that the rock must be submerged
before the ship could be brought up again. He
racked his brains to find some means of getting his gang
of men off safely in the nick of time, but it was a searching
problem to solve with only two boats, which, at the utmost,
could carry twenty-four persons. To make matters worse,
one of those mists which are so peculiar to the Scottish coast
began to settle down, blotting everything from sight.</p>

<p>The water rose higher. The men toiling on the lowest
levels receded higher and higher before the advancing tide,
though still too deeply occupied in their labours to bestow
a thought upon the <i>Smeaton</i>. At last the smith’s forge was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
quenched, and this was the general signal to the men to
prepare to leave the rock. Tools were collected, and the
party strode towards the landing-stage to enter the boats.
Conceive their consternation when they saw that one boat
was missing! When they glanced over the water the
<i>Smeaton</i> was not riding in her usual place&mdash;in fact, was
nowhere to be seen! One and all gathered around the
engineer to learn the reason for this remarkable breach in
the arrangements for their safety, and yet all were too dumbfounded
to question or protest. As for the luckless engineer,
he was at his wits’ end and could not offer a word of explanation
to the inquiring looks that besieged him. One and all,
as the water lapped their feet, realized the hopelessness of
the position. Suddenly, when they were beginning to
despair, one of the men described the phantom form of a
vessel making for the rock. “A boat!” he shouted in
exultation. Sure enough the shadow matured into the
familiar form of the Tay pilot-boat, the master of which,
observing the workmen on the rock, the rising tide, and the
absence of the <i>Smeaton</i>, had realized that something must
have gone wrong, and approached the rock to make inquiries.
He came up at the critical moment. The men
were drenched, and, their feelings having been strung to a
high pitch with anxiety, they nearly collapsed at the arrival
of this unexpected assistance. The pilot-boat, after taking
off the men, awaited the return of the <i>Smeaton</i>, which took
them on board about midnight.</p>

<p>This narrow escape so terrified the men that on the following
day the engineer found only eight of his staff of
thirty-two, who were willing to venture upon the rock again.
When this gang returned in the evening, their safety appeared
to restore courage to their companions, so that next
day all expressed their readiness to resume their tasks.</p>

<p>The fitful character of the work did not leave its mark so
distinctly as might be supposed. Whenever there was a
chance, the men worked with an amazing will and zeal;
and although the first stone of the tower was not laid until
July 10, 1808, three courses of masonry were completed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
when the undertaking was suspended at the end of November
for the winter. The succeeding season’s toil saw the
addition of about 27 feet more of the tower, which was
finally completed by the close of 1810. The building was
120 feet in height, and the light was shown for the first time
on February 1, 1811.</p>

<p>In view of the difficulties which had to be surmounted,
this “ruddy gem of changeful light,” as it is described by
Sir Walter Scott, was not particularly costly. By the time
it was brought into commission, £61,330, or $306,650, had
been expended. In 1902, after nearly a century’s service,
the tower was provided with a new light-room, so as to bring
it into conformity with modern practice.</p>

<p>While the Bell Rock tower stands as a monument to the
engineering ability of Robert Stevenson, the Skerryvore, on
the western coast, is a striking tribute to the genius of his
son, Alan. For forty years or more previous to 1844 one
ship at least had been caught and shattered every year on
this tumbled mass of gneiss. From the navigator’s point
of view, the danger of this spot lay chiefly in the fact that
it was so widely scattered. The ridge runs like a broken
backbone for a distance of some eight miles in a west-south-westerly
direction, and it is flanked on each side by isolated
rocks which jut from a badly-broken sea-bed. The whole
mass lies some distance out to sea, being ten miles south-west
of Tyree and twenty-four miles west of Iona. In rough
weather the whole of the rocks are covered, and the waves,
beating heavily on the mass, convert the scene into one of
indescribable tumult.</p>

<p>The Commissioners of Northern Lights acknowledged the
urgent need of a light upon this ridge, but it was realized
that its erection would represent the most daring feat of
lighthouse engineering that had been attempted up to this
time. There was only one point where a tower could be
placed, and this was so exposed that the safe handling of
the men and materials constituted a grave responsibility.
The rock has to withstand the full impetus of the Atlantic
waves, gathered in their 3,000 miles’ roll, and investigations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
revealed the fact that they bear down upon the Skerryvore
with a force equal to some 3 tons per square foot. It
was apparent that any masonry tower must be of prodigious
strength to resist such a battering, while at the same
time a lofty stack was imperative, because the light not
only would have to mount guard over the rock upon which
it stood, but also over a vast stretch of dangerous water on
either side.</p>

<p>After he had completed the Bell Rock light, Robert
Stevenson attacked the problem of the Skerryvore. In
order to realize the magnitude of the undertaking, some of
the Commissioners accompanied the engineer, but the experience
of pulling out into the open Atlantic on a day
when it was slightly ruffled somewhat shook their determination
to investigate the reef from close quarters. Sir
Walter Scott was a member of the party, and he has described
the journey very graphically. Before they had gone
far the Commissioners on board expressed their willingness
to leave the matter entirely in the hands of their engineer.
With grim Scottish humour, however, Robert Stevenson
insisted that the rock should be gained, so that the Commissioners
might be able to grasp the problem at first
hand.</p>

<p>But after all nothing was done. The difficulties surrounding
the work were only too apparent to the officials.
They agreed that the expense must be prodigious and that
the risks to the workmen would be grave.</p>

<p>In 1834 a second expedition was despatched to the reef
under Alan Stevenson, who had accompanied his father on
the previous occasion, and who now occupied the engineering
chair. He surveyed the reef thoroughly, traversing the
dangerous channels around the isolated humps, of which no
less than 130 were counted, at great risk to himself and his
companions. However, he achieved his object. He discovered
the best site for the tower and returned home to
prepare his plans.</p>

<p>His proposals, for those days, certainly were startling.
He decided to follow generally the principles of design, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
had been laid down by his father in regard to the Bell Rock.
But he planned something bigger and more daring. He
maintained that a tower 130 feet high, with a base diameter
of 42 feet, tapering in a curve to 16 feet at the top, was
absolutely necessary. It was the loftiest and weightiest
work of its character that had ever been contemplated up
to this time, while the peculiar situation of the reef demanded
pioneering work in all directions.</p>

<p>THE SKERRYVORE, SCOTLAND’S MOST FAMOUS LIGHTHOUSE.</p>

<p class="captionl">The erection of this tower upon a straggling low-lying reef 24 miles off Iona, and exposed to the
full fury of the Atlantic, ranks as one of the world’s engineering wonders.</p></div></div>

<p>The confidence of the Commissioners in the ability of their
engineer was so complete that he received the official
sanction to begin, and in 1838 the undertaking was commenced.
The engineer immediately formulated his plans
of campaign for a stiff struggle with Nature. One of the
greatest difficulties was the necessity to transport men,
supplies and material over a long distance, as the Scottish
coast in this vicinity is wild and sparsely populated. He
established his base on the neighbouring island of Tyree,
where barracks for the workmen, and yards for the preparation
of the material, were erected, while another colony was
established on the Isle of Mull for the quarrying of the
granite. A tiny pier or jetty had to be built at this point
to facilitate the shipment of the stone, and at Tyree a small
harbour had to be completed to receive the vessel which
was built specially for transportation purposes between the
base and the rock.</p>

<p>Another preliminary was the provision of accommodation
for the masons upon the reef. The Atlantic swell, which
rendered landing on the ridge precarious and hazardous, did
not permit the men to be housed upon a floating home, as
had been the practice in the early days of the Bell Rock
tower. In order to permit the work to go forward as uninterruptedly
as the sea would permit, a peculiar barrack
was erected. It was a house on stilts, the legs being sunk
firmly into the rock, with the living-quarters perched some
40 feet up in the air. The skeleton type of structure was
selected because it did not impede the natural movement
of the waves. It was an ingenious idea, and fulfilled the
purpose of its designer admirably, while the men became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
accustomed to their strange home after a time. For two
years it withstood the seas without incident, and the engineer
and men came to regard the eyrie as safe as a house
on shore. But one night the little colony received a shock.
The angry Atlantic got one or two of its trip-hammer blows
well home, and smashed the structure to fragments. Fortunately,
at the time it was untenanted.</p>

<p>The workmen, who were on shore waiting to go out to
the rock to resume their toil, were downcast at this unexpected
disaster, but the engineer was not at all ruffled. He
promptly sent to Glasgow for further material, and lost no
time in rebuilding the quaint barrack upon new and stronger
lines. This erection defied the waves successfully until its
demolition after the Skerryvore was finished.</p>

<p>Residence in this tower was eerie. The men climbed the
ladder and entered a small room, which served the purposes
of kitchen, dining-room, and parlour. It was barely 12 feet
across&mdash;quarters somewhat cramped for thirty men. When
a storm was raging, the waves, as they combed over the rock,
shook the legs violently and scurried under the floor in
seething foam. Now and again a roller, rising higher than
its fellows, broke upon the rock and sent a mass of water
against the flooring to hammer at the door. Above the
living-room were the sleeping-quarters, high and dry, save
when a shower of spray fell upon the roof and walls like
heavy hail, and occasionally percolated the joints of the
woodwork. The men, however, were not perturbed. Sleeping,
even under such conditions, was far preferable to
doubtful rest in a bunk upon an attendant vessel, rolling
and pitching with the motion of the sea. They had had a
surfeit of such experience during the first season’s work,
while the barrack was under erection.</p>

<p>Yet the men could not grumble. The engineer responsible
for the work shared their privations and discomforts, for
Alan Stevenson clung to the rock night and day while work
was in progress, and he has given a very vivid impression of
life in this quaint home on legs. He relates how he “spent
many a weary day and night&mdash;at those times when the sea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
prevented anyone going down to the rock&mdash;anxiously looking
for supplies from the shore, and earnestly looking for a
change of weather favourable for prosecuting the works.
For miles around nothing could be seen but white foaming
breakers, and nothing heard but howling winds and lashing
waves. At such seasons much of our time was spent in
bed, for there alone we had effectual shelter from the winds
and spray, which searched every cranny in the walls of the
barrack. Our slumbers, too, were at times fearfully interrupted
by the sudden pouring of the sea over the roof, the
rocking of the house on its pillars, and the spurting of water
through the seams of the doors and windows&mdash;symptoms
which, to one suddenly aroused from sound sleep, recalled
the appalling fate of the former barrack, which had been
engulfed in the foam not 20 yards from our dwelling, and
for a moment seemed to summon us to a similar fate.”</p>

<p>The work upon the rock was tedious and exasperating in
the extreme. The gneiss was of maddening hardness and
obstinacy&mdash;“four times as tough as Aberdeen granite” was
the general opinion. The Atlantic, pounding the rock continuously
through the centuries, had faced it smoother than
could any mason with his tools, yet had not left it sufficiently
sound to receive the foundations. In the external
layer, which the masons laboured strenuously to remove
with their puny tools, there were cracks and crevices here
and there. The stubborn rock played havoc with the finest
chisels and drills, and clearing had to be effected for the
most part by the aid of gunpowder. This powerful agent,
however, could only be used sparingly and with extreme
skill, so that the rock-face might not be shivered or shattered
too severely. Moreover, the men ran extreme risks,
for the rock splintered like glass, and the flying chips were
capable of doing as much damage, when thus impelled, as
a bullet.</p>

<p>While the foundations were being prepared, and until the
barrack was constructed, the men ran other terrible risks
every morning and night in landing upon and leaving the
polished surface of the reef. Five months during the summer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
was the working season, but even then many days and
weeks were often lost owing to the swell being too great to
permit the rowing-boat to come alongside. The engineer
relates that the work was “a good lesson in the school of
patience,” because the delays were frequent and galling,
while every storm which got up and expended its rage upon
the reef left its mark indelibly among the engineer’s stock-in-trade.
Cranes and other material were swept away as
if they were corks; lashings, no matter how strong, were
snapped like pack-threads. Time after time the tender
lying alongside had to weigh anchor hurriedly, and make a
spirited run to its haven at Tyree.</p>

<p>When the barrack was erected, the situation was eased
somewhat, but then the hours became long. Operations
being confined to the summer months, the average working
day was from four in the morning until nine in the evening&mdash;seventeen
hours&mdash;with intervals for meals; but the men
were not averse to the prolonged daily toil, inasmuch as
cessation brought no welcome relaxations, but rather encouraged
broodings over their isolated position, whereas
occupation served to keep the mind engaged. Twice the
men had severe frights during the night. On each occasion
a violent storm sprang up after they had gone to bed, and
one or two ugly breakers, getting their blows home, shook
the eyrie with the force of an earthquake. Every man
leaped out of his bunk, and one or two of the more timid, in
their fright, hurried down the ladder and spent the remaining
spell of darkness shivering and quaking on the completed
trunk of the lighthouse, deeming it to be safer than
the crazy-looking structure which served as their home.</p>

<p>Two years were occupied upon the foundations, the first
stone being laid by the Duke of Argyll on July 7, 1840.
This eminent personage evinced a deep interest in the work
and the difficulties which had to be overcome, and as proprietor
of the island of Tyree extended to the Commissioners
free permission to quarry any granite they required from
any part of his estate.</p>

<p>For a height of some 21 feet from the foundation level the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
tower is a solid trunk of masonry. Then come the entrance
and water-tanks, followed by nine floors, comprising successively
coal-store, workshop, storeroom, kitchen, two bedrooms,
library, oil-store, and light-room, the whole occupying
a height of 130 feet, crowned by the lantern. As a
specimen of lighthouse engineering, the Skerryvore has become
famous throughout the world. The stones forming
the solid courses at the bottom are attached to one another
so firmly and ingeniously as to secure the maximum of
strength and solidity, the result being that nothing short of
an earthquake could overthrow the stalk of masonry.</p>

<p>The erection of the superstructure was by no means free
from danger and excitement. The working space both on
the tower itself and around the base was severely cramped.
The men at the latter point had to keep a vigilant eye upon
those working above, since, despite the most elaborate precautions,
falls of tools and other heavy bodies were by no
means infrequent. Notwithstanding its perilous character,
the undertaking was free from accident and fatality, and,
although the men were compelled by force of circumstances
to depend mostly upon salt foodstuffs, the little colony
suffered very slightly from the ravages of dysentery.</p>

<p>Probably the worst experience was when the men on the
rock were weather-bound for seven weeks during one season.
The weather broke suddenly. Heavy seas and adverse winds
raged so furiously that the steamboat dared not put out of
its haven, but remained there with steam up, patiently
waiting for a lull in the storm, during which they might
succour the unfortunate men on the reef. The latter passed
a dreary, pitiable time. Their provisions sank to a very
low level, they ran short of fuel, their sodden clothing was
worn to rags, and, what was far worse from their point of
view, their tobacco became exhausted. The average working
man will tolerate extreme discomfort and privation so
long as the friendship of his pipe remains, but the denial of
this companion comes as the last straw.</p>

<p>The lantern is of special design, and is one of the most
powerful around the Scottish coasts. It is of the revolving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
class, reaching its brightest state once every minute, and
may be seen from the deck of a vessel eighteen miles away.
Six years were occupied in the completion of the work, and,
as may be imagined, the final touches were welcomed with
thankfulness by all those who had been concerned in the
enterprise. The tower contains 4,308 tons of granite, and
the total cost was £86,977, or $434,885, rendering it one of
the costliest in the world. This sum, however, included the
purchase of the steam-vessel which now attends the lighthouse,
and the construction of the little harbour at Hynish.</p>

<p>The lighthouse-keepers live on the island of Tyree, where
are provided substantial, spacious, single-floor, masonry
dwellings with gardens attached. This is practically a
small colony in itself, inasmuch as the accommodation includes,
not only that for the keepers of the Skerryvore, but
for the guardians of the Dhu-Heartach light as well.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LONELY LIGHTS OF SCOTLAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Barren ruggedness, ragged reefs, and towering cliffs form
an apt description of the north and west coasts of Scotland,
and he is a prudent navigator who acknowledges the respect
which these shores demand, by giving them a wide berth.
The Norwegian coast is serrated, the island of Newfoundland
may be likened to the battered edge of a saw,
but Scotland is unique in its formation. The coastline is
torn and tattered by bays and firths, with scattered outlying
ramparts. The captain of a “tramp” who has sailed
the seven seas once confessed to me that no stretch of coastline
ever gave him the shivers so badly as the stretch of
shore between Duncansby Head and the Mull of Kintyre.</p>

<p>Certainly a ship “going north about” is menaced every
mile of her way between these two points unless she takes
a very circuitous course. If the weather conditions are
favourable and daylight prevails, the North of Britain may
be rounded through the narrow strait washing the mainland
and the Orkney Islands, but the Pentland Firth is not an
attractive short-cut. The ships that run between Scandinavian
ports and North America naturally follow this route,
as it is several hundred miles shorter than that via the North
Sea and English Channel; but they keep a sharp eye on the
weather and are extremely cautious. When the Pentland
Firth is uninviting, they may either choose the path between
the Orkneys and the Shetlands, or, to eliminate every
element of risk, may stand well out to sea, and round the
most northern stretches of the Shetlands. These are lonely
seas, comparatively speaking, and yet are well lighted.
Although a wicked rock lies in the centre of the eastern
entrance to the Pentland channel, it is indicated by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Pentland Skerries light. When the mariner in his wisdom
pushes still farther north, he falls within the glare of the
rays thrown from the beacon near Muckle Flugga. This
is the northernmost point of the British Islands, and it is
truly forbidding. The rock lies three-quarters of a mile
off the Shetland Islands, and is a huge fang, sheering to a
height of 196 feet above high-water. On the side facing
north it rears up so abruptly that it appears to lean over,
while on the opposite side it is almost as steep.</p>

<p>The majority of lighthouses have been called into existence
by the claims of commerce purely and simply. But
it was not so with the North Unst lighthouse, as the beacon
crowning this pinnacle is called. War was responsible for
its creation, though probably sooner or later the requirements
of peace would have brought about a similar result.
While the armies of France and Britain were fighting the
Russians in the Crimea, the British fleet was hovering about
these waters, watching the mouth of the Baltic, so as to
frustrate any attempts on the part of the Russian fleet to
dash around the northern coast of Scotland. In those days
these lonely seas were badly lighted, and the Admiralty
realized only too well the many perils to which the warships
were exposed while cruising about the pitiless coasts of
the Orkneys and Shetlands. Accordingly, the department
called upon the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses
to mark Muckle Flugga. Time was everything, and the
engineers were urged to bring a temporary light into operation
with the least delay.</p>

<p>The engineers hurriedly evolved a tower which would
meet the Government needs. It was thought that the extreme
height of the rock would lend itself to the erection of
a building which, while possible of early completion, would
be adequate for subsequent purposes. The materials for
the light, together with a lantern, and a second building for
the storage of the oil and other requisites, were shipped
northward from Glasgow. Simultaneously the engineers,
with another small gang of men who had already reached
the rock, pushed on with the preliminary preparations, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
that when the constructional vessel arrived erection might
go ahead straightforwardly and rapidly.</p>

<p class="captionc">To the left is the lower part of the temporary structure in which the builders lived while erection was in progress.</p></div></div>

<p>The engineers tried the rock from all sides to find a safe
landing. This was no light matter, owing to the steepness
of the slope even upon the easiest face of the pinnacle. The
attempt represented a mild form of mountaineering, for the
sea had battered away the projection of the lower-lying
levels, and the men found it trying to effect a foothold, even
in stepping from the boat on to the rock. They had to
climb hand over hand up the precipice, with life-lines round
their waists, taking advantage of every narrow ledge. With
infinite labour they gained the summit, and then they found
that there was just sufficient space, and no more, upon which
to plant the lighthouse buildings.</p>

<p>The top was cleared quickly, and then the advance party
set to work to improve the landing-place on the south side of
the rock for the reception of the building materials. A small
site was prepared with great difficulty, as the tough rock
offered a stern resistance to the chisels, drills, and wedges;
while in addition the men had to cut steps in the flank of
the rock to facilitate the ascent to the site.</p>

<p>On September 14, 1854, the constructional vessel <i>Pharos</i>
hove in sight, and, the weather being favourable, the landing
of the material was hurried forward. The men had to
become pack-animals for the time, carrying the loads on
their backs. In this manner they tramped laboriously up
and down the cliff-face with material and stores of all descriptions.
The heavier and bulkier parts were hauled up by
rope and tackle, a few feet at a time, and this task was
quite as exacting. In all, 120 tons were conveyed to the
top of the crag. Construction was hastened just as feverishly,
and on October 11, 1854, twenty-six days after the
<i>Pharos</i> anchored off Muckle Flugga, the North Unst light
shone out for the first time. This is probably one of the
most brilliant exploits that has ever been consummated in
connection with lighthouse engineering, the merit of which
is additionally impressive from the fact that almost everything
had to be accomplished by manual effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
While the light was admittedly of a temporary character,
the importance of the outpost had been appreciated, and
it was determined to erect a permanent light upon the rock
for the guidance of those who compass the North of Scotland
in order to pass from and to the North Atlantic. It
was decided to commence the permanent masonry building
the following year, and a gang of men volunteered to stay
behind on the rock throughout the winter to complete all
the essential preparations for the foundations. Accommodation
was available for this staff in a substantial iron shelter,
in which they made themselves comfortable for the winter.</p>

<p>But it is during this season that the winds from the north,
lashing the sea to fury, create huge rollers which thunder
upon the base of the pinnacle to crawl up its perpendicular
face in the form of broken water and spray. The men
standing on the brink often watched these rollers, but never
for a moment thought that one would be able to leap to a
height of nearly 200 feet and sweep over the rock. The
December gales dispelled this illusion very convincingly.
One morning the workmen, while breakfasting in their warm
shelter, received a big surprise. A terrific blow struck the
door, which flew open as if hit by a cannon-ball. It was
followed instantly by a three-foot wall of water. The broken
wave rushed round the apartment, seething and foaming,
and then out again. The workmen were dumbfounded, but
had scarcely recovered from the shock when another roll of
water came crashing in and gave the apartment another
thorough flushing out. One of the Scottish workmen vouchsafed
the remark that the man responsible for cleaning the
floors that day would be spared his job, but he was silenced
when, a few seconds later, another angry sheet of water
dropped on the roof of the building and threatened to
smash it in.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE NORTH UNST, BRITAIN’S MOST NORTHERLY LIGHT.</p>

<p class="captionc">The tower is perched on the top of a precipitous crag, the light being 260 feet above the sea. Despite this height, the waves often dash over the lantern.</p></div></div>

<p>The closing month of that year was particularly boisterous.
Time after time when the sea rose, the lighthouse
tower was drenched in water. One might think it impossible
that a wave could get up sufficient impetus to
mount a height of 200 feet; but this experience offered conclusive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
testimony to the contrary and to the immense power
of the waves when they have an uninterrupted run over
several hundred miles of open ocean.</p>

<p>In a way, the terrifying experience of these marooned
workmen was invaluable. They reported the bare facts to
the engineers upon the first opportunity, and this intelligence
brought about a revision in the designs for the permanent
masonry structure.</p>

<p>The present North Unst lighthouse is a massive masonry
building, standing in the centre of the small flat space on the
top of the pinnacle, with heavy masonry walls bounding it
on all sides. The tower is 64 feet in height, while the red
and white light may be seen from a distance of twenty-one
miles in clear weather. That the winter storms of 1854
were by no means exceptional has been proved up to the
hilt on several occasions since. When the nor’-wester is
roused thoroughly, the breaking waves curl up the cliff and
rush over the lantern. Such a climb of 260 feet conveys a
compelling notion of the force of the sea. The weight of the
water thrown into the air has threatened to overthrow the
massive boundary walls, while now and again the invader
leaves tangible evidences of its power by smashing the
windows of the lantern. Upon one occasion it burst open
the heavy door, which weighs the best part of a ton.</p>

<p>The light-station is served by four keepers, two on duty
simultaneously, their homes being on the island of Unst,
four miles away. For the conveyance of water, fuel, provisions,
and other requirements, from the landing-stage to
the lighthouse 200 feet above, an inclined railway has been
provided on the easier slope, so that the men are no longer
called upon to pack their provisions, like mules, from the
water-level up a steep cliff, as was formerly required.</p>

<p>Rounding these island dangers, the navigator picks up
the light of Cape Wrath, glimmering from a height of
370 feet above the water-level and standing at the western
corner of the rectangular head of the Scottish mainland.
Going south, he has two passages available&mdash;the inner,
which extends through the Minches and inside the Hebrides;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
or the outer, which lies beyond the latter rampart. In
making the outer passage he comes within range of the
light shining from the summit of a lonely group of rocks
standing some twenty-two miles out to sea off the Isle of
Lewis. These are the Flannen Islands, or Seven Hunters,
one of many similar lonely Scottish stations. The tower is
mounted upon the crown of one of the highest points, and
the white group-flashing light is visible over a radius of
twenty-four miles. Farther south the seafarer picks up
and drops the Monach Islands light, likewise lying out in
the Atlantic, some ten miles from the nearest land. Finally,
rounding Barra Head, the most southerly point of the reef
lying off Barra Island, the light from which is cast 580 feet
above the water owing to the height of the cliff, the vessel
slips into a huge indentation, where isolated rocks peep
above the Atlantic, one of the most dangerous of which is
indicated by the Skerryvore lighthouse.</p>

<p>I have described the Skerryvore light in the previous
chapter; but nineteen and a half miles to the south-east of
the latter is another reef, just as exposed, which is as perilous
in every respect. Indeed, it may be said to constitute a
greater menace to the navigation of these waters, since it lies
in the cross-roads of the entrance to the Irish Channel, the
Firth of the Clyde, and the Minches. A powerful light
mounts guard on the Rhins of Islay, twenty-seven miles
due south, but between the latter and Skerryvore there are
forty-three miles of coast, as dangerous as the mariner could
wish to avoid, with this rock looming up almost halfway.</p>

<p>This peril is the Dhu-Heartach, lying out to sea in deep
water, fourteen miles from the nearest point of the mainland.
The physical configuration of the sea-bed at this point is
somewhat similar to that prevailing at Skerryvore. The
Ross of Mull tumbles abruptly into the Atlantic, to reappear
out to sea in the form of the Torrin Rocks, which run for a
distance of four and a half miles in the direction of Dhu-Heartach.
Then the reef comes to a sudden stop, to be
seen once more, nine miles farther out, in the rounded hump
of Dhu-Heartach, this being practically the outermost point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
of the ridge. Being so isolated and projecting so suddenly
from deep water, this ledge claimed many victims among
the vessels frequenting these unlighted waters. The Commissioners
of Northern Lighthouses were assailed for not
marking the danger spot in some form or other. The
authorities, however, were fully alive to the need of such
protection, but it was not until 1867 that they were able to
proceed with the erection of a lighthouse.</p>

<p>The situation is peculiar, and the engineers, Messrs. D.
and T. Stevenson, were faced with a somewhat perplexing
problem recalling those which had arisen in conjunction
with the Skerryvore, not far distant. Indeed, the Dhu-Heartach
undertaking might very well be described as a
repetition of those struggles, with a few more difficulties of
a different character thrown in. The rock itself in reality
is a series of islets, or hummocks, surrounding the main
hump, which is 240 feet in length by 130 feet in breadth,
the highest point of the rounded top being 35 feet above
high-water at ordinary spring-tides. On all sides the lead
marks very deep water, the result being that in times of
storm and tempest the rollers of the Atlantic, having a
“fetch” of some 3,000 miles or more, thunder upon it with
terrific force, the broken water leaping high into the air.
It is very seldom that the rock can be approached even in a
small boat and with a calm sea, as the hump is invariably
encircled in a scarf of ugly surf. The swell strikes the
western face of the rock, is divided, flows round the northern
and southern ends of the obstruction, and reunites on the
eastern side. Consequently the rock is nearly always a
centre of disturbance.</p>

<p>The distance of the rock from the mainland complicated
the issue very materially. A suitable site had to be prepared
on shore as a base, where the stones could be prepared for
shipment, while a special steam-tender was necessary to run
to and fro. The handling of the workmen had to be carried
out upon the lines which were adopted at Skerryvore&mdash;namely,
the erection of a barrack upon a skeleton framework
on the rock, where the men might be left safely for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
days or weeks at a time. The shore station selected was at
Earraid, on the neighbouring island of Mull, because it was
the nearest strategical point to the work, and because ample
supplies of first-class granite were available in the immediate
vicinity, the proprietor, the Duke of Argyll, as in the
previous instance, facilitating the work as far as possible.</p>

<p>The authority to commence operations was given on
March 11, 1867, and this year was devoted to completing
preparations, so that in the following season work might be
started in earnest and carried on throughout the summer
at high pressure. The first task was the erection of the
barrack on the rock. The workmen got ashore for the first
time on June 25, 1867, and, although landing at all times
was trying and perilous, attempts often having to be abandoned
owing to the swell, the engineer succeeded in landing
twenty-seven times up to September 3, when work had to
be suspended until the following year. Despite the shortness
of the season, the men made appreciable headway.
The iron framework of the barrack was completed to the
first tier, while a good beginning was made upon the rock-face
in connection with the foundations for the lighthouse.
When the autumnal gales approached, everything in connection
with the barrack was left secure, the builders being
anxious to ascertain how it would weather the winter gales
and the force and weight of the waves which bore down
upon it.</p>

<p>The engineers finally decided upon a tower 107½ feet in
height. After trying various curves for the outline, they
came to the decision that a parabolic frustum would afford
the most serviceable design, as well as providing the maximum
of strength. A diameter of 36 feet was chosen for the
base, tapering gradually and gracefully to one of 16 feet at
the top, with the entrance 32 feet above the base, to which
point the cone was to be solid.</p>

<p>The arrangements were that work should be resumed in
the early spring of 1868, so as to secure full advantage of the
favourable easterly winds. Accordingly, when the special
steam-tender arrived on April 14, she was loaded up with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
necessaries and men, ready to proceed to the site directly
the wind should veer round to the desired point of the
compass. But with aggravating persistency it clung to the
west and south-west until the end of June, so that many
valuable weeks were unfortunately lost. Time after time,
when there was a lull in the weather, the steamer put out
from Earraid, the engineers determined to make a dash for
the rock, and as many times they were foiled, as the men
could not be got through the surf. One day, however, an
hour and a half was snatched on the rock, and, although
no work could be done in that time, yet the interval was
sufficient to enable the engineers to take a look round and to
see how their handiwork had withstood the heavy gales of
the previous winter. There was only one marked evidence
of the Atlantic’s wrath. One section of the iron ring connecting
the heads of the legs of the barrack at a height of
30 feet had been carried away.</p>

<p>On June 29 the wind moderated sufficiently to enable the
men to be landed, but the climatic conditions remained
adverse. The wind refused to swing round to the east; a
westerly swell was the luck day after day. The engineers
had to dodge the ocean as best they could, and some idea of
the handicap under which they laboured may be gathered
from the fact that only four landings were made during the
sixty-one days of May and June. July enabled the greatest
number of landings to be effected&mdash;thirteen; while during
August and September the men only gained the rock on
twenty-one occasions, making a total of thirty-eight landings
in the course of 153 days.</p>

<p>During this interrupted season, however, the barrack was
completed. It was a massive structure, and resembled a
huge iron barrel secured endwise upon an intricate arrangement
of stilts which were heavily stayed and tied together
by diagonals and cross-members. In the two previous
instances where a similar arrangement had been adopted
the temporary dwelling had been wrought in wood, but on
this occasion the engineers decided to adopt iron, as they
concluded that a wooden structure would not fare well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
against the heavy seas. This was a fortunate decision,
because, as subsequent experience proved, a wooden barrack
would have received very short shrift from the Atlantic
breakers; in fact, probably it would have gone down with
the first sou’-wester. The iron barrack, as the workmen
narrated, was pounded and battered by the waves most
unmercifully; but although it suffered at times, quivering
and shaking under the terrific impacts, it weathered all the
onslaughts.</p>

<p>One interesting incident serves to illustrate the perils to
which the workmen were exposed. A date had been set
down when all the men were to be brought off the rock for
the season, as the approach of the equinox rendered further
toil extremely doubtful, and there was no intention of unduly
imperilling them. The engineer’s resident representative,
Mr. Alexander Brebner, went out to the rock on August 20,
the day fixed for the suspension of operations, to inspect the
progress that had been made and to have a last look round.
At the time of his arrival the weather was beautifully calm,
and held out every promise of remaining settled for several
days. As the season had been so adverse, he decided, on
his own responsibility, to delay the cessation of toil, so, with
the thirteen men, he remained on the rock, determined to
make up leeway somewhat while the weather held out.</p>

<p>But the resident paid the penalty for his disobedience.
The little party retired that night with the stars shining
brilliantly overhead from a cloudless sky, and with the sea
like a mirror. In the middle of the night one and all were
roused suddenly from their slumbers. The wind was roaring,
and the breakers were hammering upon the rock, while the
foam and surf rushed violently between the legs of the
barracks. When the men looked out they were confronted
with a terrifying spectacle. The night was black as pitch,
but the sea white as a snow-covered plain, from the crests
of the rollers and the surf playing on and around the rocks.
A furious gale had sprung up with the characteristic suddenness
of the Atlantic, and was already raging. The next
morning no one dared to venture outside the iron home,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
while the gale, instead of abating, appeared to be increasing in
fury. For five days the men were held fast, and at times their
fears got the better of them. This was particularly the case
when, now and again, a more than ugly wave got up, rolled
over the rock, and crashed with full force against the barrack.
The building shook and trembled fearfully, but its legs
were driven too deeply into the rock for it to be overturned,
while the cross-bracing was too intricate for the legs to be
snapped off. Again and again the men were plunged into
darkness, as a wall of water rushed right over the drum,
notwithstanding that the roof was 77 feet above high-water.</p>

<p>Their fears rose almost to frenzy when a breaker, leaping
the rock, drove full tilt against the floor of the barrack. In
this upward rush of 55 feet the building suffered. The men’s
entrance to the home was by means of a heavy hatch, or
trapdoor, which was bolted securely upon the inside.
This particular comber burst in the hatch as if it were no
thicker than the wood of a matchbox, flooding the whole
compartment.</p>

<p>Meantime the engineer-in-chief at Edinburgh had heard
of the incident. He had given strict instructions that the
men should be brought off on August 20, and when the intelligence
was communicated to him that his order had been
disobeyed, and that his men were in serious straits, he
became distracted. He knew only too well how the waves
bombard Dhu-Heartach. Mr. David Stevenson related to me
how his father paced the offices during the day, and his own
home at night, unable to drown his thoughts in work or sleep.
His worry was intensified as the true character of the gale
came to his ears. He had planned everything with such
care that neither life nor limb of a single workman need be
jeopardized, and here he was confronted with the possibility
of losing fourteen men at one stroke! The iron
barrack, although staunchly constructed, was just as likely
as not to succumb to the full brunt of a very vicious sou’-wester,
so there was every excuse for his anxiety. He gave
orders that the steam-tender was to stand by with steam
raised, so as to make a dash for the rock upon the first opportunity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
No one had a moment’s peace until at last the
news came through that the steam-tender had been out to
the rock, and with much difficulty had got hold of the fourteen
men and brought them ashore, somewhat scared and
bearing evidences of their experience, but unharmed. Mr.
Stevenson told me that he could not quite say which was
worse&mdash;the distracted wanderings of his father, or the expression
of his pent-up feelings when he met the unfortunate
resident a few days later, who was taken severely to task
for his flagrant breach of orders, whereby the lives of the
workmen had been imperilled so unnecessarily.</p>

<p>The year 1869 was kinder to the engineers, and great
headway was made. The men were able to make their
first landing on the rock as early as March 25, and it was
accessible up to October 29, when all forces withdrew from
the scene for the winter. During this period sixty landings
were effected, while heavy supplies of masonry and other
materials were shipped to the site. The masons took up
their permanent residence in the barrack on April 26, and
did not leave it until September 3, while they were able to
squeeze in 113 days of toil, with a welcome rest from their
labours on Sundays. The excavations for the foundations
were completed speedily, and on June 24 the erection of the
tower was commenced. The stones were brought ready
for setting in position, and were laid so rapidly that by the
end of the month two courses were completed and the third
had been well advanced. Then came a temporary setback.
A blusterous summer gale sprang up, and the sea, after
assaulting the rock for two days, succeeded in leaving its
mark. The crane and other tackle at the landing-stage
were washed away, while fourteen stones laid in the third
course were uprooted, of which eleven were seen no more.
The water in this case had to leap upwards for 35½ feet,
while the stones which it carried away weighed 2 tons
apiece, and were firmly joggled, so that the wrench which
displaced them must have been terrific indeed.</p>

<p>If a summer gale could wreak such damage, what was the
dreaded equinox likely to achieve? The engineers were so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
much impressed that they thereupon made assurance doubly
sure by effecting a modification of the original plans. When
the work was commenced, it was intended to take the solid
part of the tower up to a height of 52 feet 10 inches above
high-water. The effects of this summer gale induced them
to continue the solid section a further 11½ feet, so that the
entrance level is 64 feet 4 inches above high-water mark.
The result is that the solid base of the Dhu-Heartach tower
weighs no less than 1,840 tons&mdash;more than one-half the total
weight of the structure&mdash;and is executed throughout in
massive blocks of grey granite.</p>

<p>The tower contains six floors above the entrance hall,
these, on ascending the spiral staircase, being as follows:
oil-store, kitchen, provision-store, bedroom, dry-room, and
light-room. The masonry part of the work was completed
by the end of the season of 1871, and the first-order dioptric,
fixed, white light was exhibited on November 1, 1872. The
focal plane, being 145 feet above the water-level, has a range
of eighteen nautical miles. The total cost of the work was
£76,084, or $380,420, of which sum the shore station was
responsible for £10,300, or $51,500.</p>

<p>The ocean made an attempt to defeat the workmanship
and skill of the engineers in the very winter following the
opening of the lighthouse. On the lee side of the tower
there is a copper lightning-conductor, 1 inch thick by 1½
inches wide, which is let into a channel cut in the stonework,
so that it comes flush with the face of the building.
This conductor is fixed at intervals of 5 feet in a substantial
manner. The winter storms of 1872 tore some 10 feet out
of this channel near the base of the structure, and wrenched
the screws from their sockets; while at the kitchen window
level, which is 92 feet above high-water, the rod was similarly
disturbed for some distance. It will be seen that the
waves which assail Dhu-Heartach are by no means to be
despised.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FASTNET, THE OUTPOST OF EUROPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Four and a half miles out to sea, separated from Cape
Clear, the most south-westerly point of Ireland, by a
treacherous channel, rises the jagged, formidable shape of
the Fastnet. To mariners the rock, with its brilliant
shaft of light by night, has developed into more than a
mere beacon. It is the first and last light of the Old World
on the eastward and westward passages across the Atlantic.
All passing vessels are “spoken” from this point to London,
New York, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was in the early fifties of the past century that the
engineer conceived the idea of planting a light upon this
lonely crag. Maritime interests had agitated for a beacon
for many years previously, since, although a warning gleam
was thrown from the station on Cape Clear, this ray often
was invisible, or partially obscured, owing to the wreaths
of cloud and mist which draped the summit of the headland.
The builder was Mr. George Halpin, engineer to the Port
of Dublin Corporation, which was responsible at that time
for the illumination of the shores of Ireland.</p>

<p>His task was not to be despised. The Fastnet itself is
merely a pinnacle, rising precipitously to a height of about
100 feet above low-water, but it is the centre of many
dangers. It is flanked on all sides by needle-points and
ridges; the currents run strongly, and the tides are wicked,
rendering approach uncertain even in the smoothest weather.</p>

<p>The indefatigable engineer attacked his task boldly. He
chose the highest point of the rock as the site for his tower,
which was a cast-iron cylindrical building, 91 feet in height.
The lantern was equipped with a revolving apparatus
which threw a flash of 38,000 candle-power for fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
seconds once every two minutes from an elevation of 148 feet,
rotation being obtained through a belt and a weight-driven
clock. Its erection was a tedious undertaking; although
a start was made in 1848, it was not until January 1, 1854,
that the light first cast its welcome rays over the wastes of
the Atlantic, by which time £20,000, or $100,000, had been
spent upon the undertaking.</p>

<p>BUILDING THE FASTNET ROCK LIGHTHOUSE.</p>

<p class="captionc">Looking down from the top of the rock upon the men setting one of the solid masonry courses.</p></div></div>

<p>For ten years Halpin’s work successfully defied the
elements, although at times the keepers grew somewhat
apprehensive concerning its stability. Time after time,
during heavy gales, it seemed as if it must succumb to the
storm. The waves curled up the cliff and struck the tower
with staggering force, causing it to tremble like a leaf. On
one occasion a cup of coffee standing upon the table was
thrown to the floor. While the shaft defied the most severe
poundings, the cliff itself gave way, and large masses of rock
on which the tower stood were carried away. One huge
chunk, weighing some 3 tons, was detached, and, as it
slipped down, was picked up by the next incoming wave,
to be hurled with terrific force against the tower, but without
inflicting any marked damage. On another occasion a
cask containing 60 gallons of fresh water, which the keepers
had made fast to the railing of the gallery surrounding the
lantern, 133 feet above the water, was wrenched free by a
wave which dashed over the rock, and was swept away as if
it were an empty tin. The keepers’ anxiety under these
circumstances may be understood.</p>

<p>At last, in April, 1865, the consulting engineer to the
Corporation visited the lighthouse in company with Mr.
George Stevenson, the famous Scottish lighthouse builder,
to examine the rock thoroughly. The latter suggested
certain recommendations to insure the stability of the tower;
but when the sanction of the Brethren of Trinity House was
sought, they deferred a decision until their own engineer
had visited the works, although they appreciated Mr.
Stevenson’s advice.</p>

<p>Some of the recommendations advanced by Mr. Stevenson
were followed subsequently, and this reluctant recognition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
of his knowledge brought its reward. The authorities&mdash;now
the Commissioners of Irish Lights&mdash;had a fright in
1881. The storms of that winter were among the heaviest
that have ever assailed the British Islands. The Calf Rock
light, which was a similar tower to the Fastnet, and which
had been strengthened upon identical lines, came to grief.
The tower was broken off at the point where the reinforcement
ceased. This disaster naturally aroused many misgivings
concerning the luck of the Fastnet. Had it shared
a similar fate during the same gale? To their intense
relief, the Commissioners found that it had issued from the
conflict with no more injuries than a few broken panes of
glass.</p>

<p>The tower withstood the attacks of wind and wave successfully
until 1891, when the Commissioners came to the
conclusion that it was time the Fastnet light was improved,
to meet the requirements of the busier mercantile traffic
passing the point. Accordingly, Mr. William Douglass,
the engineer to the Commissioners, recommended a new
tower, fitted with the latest form of illumination, so as to
bring it into line with the other leading lights of the world.
He advocated a tower of masonry with the focal plane
at an elevation of 159 feet; the shaft, 147 feet high, springing
from a position 6 inches below high-water, with a
diameter at the base of 42 feet. The cost of the light was
estimated at £70,000 or $350,000.</p>

<p>One cannot help admiring the daring of the engineer,
since he declined to be assisted by the rock summit in his
purpose. Instead he preferred the ledge of a chasm on the
hardest part of the rock below high-tide, and directly
exposed to the full force of the sea. He maintained that
such a tower, planted on this shelf, would receive the force
of the heaviest seas before they rose to their full height;
also by building the base of the tower in the form of steps,
as in the case of a breakwater, an excellent buffer would be
offered to the rollers.</p>

<p>The new design came at an opportune moment. Another
inspection of the existing tower by Mr. C.&nbsp;W. Scott, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
present engineer-in-chief to the Commissioners, revealed a
parlous state of affairs. Halpin’s building was on the verge
of collapse. Many of the plates in the upper stories had
worked loose under the poundings inflicted by the seas, and
in many instances the bolts holding the fabric together
were sheared. Repairs had to be made hastily to enable
the old tower to hold out until the new lighthouse was
erected.</p>

<p>Before the work was commenced, the designer, as a
result of further investigation, decided to increase the
diameter of his tower to 52 feet at the base. The lowest
courses did not comprise complete rings of masonry, but
were anchored at the points where the circle was broken
into the face of the cliff, so as to form an integral part
thereof, as it were. The depth of this partial ringwork is
26 feet, at which level the first complete ring of masonry
was laid. Thenceforward the tower is solid throughout its
thickness for a further height of 30 feet, except for a central
circular space forming the water-tank, which holds 3,250
gallons of water. From this point the masonry structure
rises gracefully to a height of 88<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> feet to the lantern gallery.
The lighthouse is divided into eight floors, affording living-rooms
for the keepers, storerooms for oil, fog-signals,
provisions, coal, etc.</p>

<p>The lighthouse, the landing-stage, and other appurtenances,
are executed in Cornish granite throughout. The
blocks were fashioned from picked stone of fine, close, hard
grain, and ranged up to 4 and 5 tons in weight. The method
of construction followed the approved lines of to-day, in
which each stone is dovetailed into its neighbour, above,
below, and on either side. As the stones were cut and
fitted in the Cornish quarries, they were set up and fitted
course by course. Then, when they had met the approbation
of the engineer deputed for this duty, they were numbered
and given other identification marks, so that upon
reaching the base at Rock Island, upon the Irish mainland,
within easy reach of the Fastnet, they could be despatched
in rotation to the site, to be set in position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
It was in August, 1896, that the first little squad of
labourers landed on the Fastnet, under the superintendence
of James Kavanagh, a first-class all-round mason&mdash;one of
those men who occupy a unique position when emergency
calls. He was just the type of foreman that the task
demanded, careful, daring, a hard worker, zealous, dauntless.
Once he had landed on the rock to prepare the foundations,
he seldom left it; and, what is more, every stone constituting
the tower was well and truly laid by his own hand. It was
indeed unfortunate that Kavanagh, after his momentous
round of toil was over, should be stricken down with
apoplexy, to which he succumbed, after virtually years of
imprisonment upon an ill-famed rock, facing discomforts
and privations of all descriptions, and seizing every opportunity
to drive the task forward. It was as if Nature,
baffled in her efforts to circumvent the work of human
ingenuity, had taken revenge upon the man who had
laboured mightily to complete her subjection.</p>

<p>Kavanagh took with him upon the rock a small boiler
and steam-winch, which he set up without delay, to land
both workmen and necessaries. He lost no time in cutting
away at the toe of the cliff, to admit the first partial ring
of stones. It was a ding-dong battle between the masons
and the sea for the first few rounds. The men toiled
heroically with their chisels between the coming of the
rollers, with one eye on the water and the other on a handy
life-line, which they grabbed when the Atlantic endeavoured
to steal a march upon them. On some days splendid progress
was made; on others the masons never drove the
chisels once into the rock-face.</p>

<p>Landing was an exciting experience in itself. The tender,
naturally, could not draw right in, owing to the swell and
other dangers. She stood off a little way, and there
anchored. When men were coming to or going from the
rock, the rope was run out from the derrick. To this was
attached a kind of double stirrup, not unlike a child’s
swing. The men took up their position, two at a time, on
these stirrups, standing face to face. At the command,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
“Lower away!” or “Heave ho!” the derrick winch commenced
to grunt and rattle, and the men were whisked
into mid-air, clutching tightly to their frail, cramped hold,
and steadied in their aerial journey by another rope extending
to the rowing-boat below. It was an exciting trip
while it lasted, and at first glimpse appeared to be dangerous,
so much so that on one or two occasions the courage of raw
hands broke down at the last moment, and they hesitated
to trust themselves to such a flimsy-looking vehicle.</p>

<p>Bringing the stones ashore was even more difficult. It
was imperative that the edges and corners of the blocks
should be protected from blows which might chip and scar
them, thereby impairing their true fit, and possibly allowing
the sea to get a purchase in its efforts to destroy. Accordingly,
the blocks were packed in skeleton crates, with substantial
wooden battens completely protecting the vital
parts. It was impossible to swing them singly direct
through the air from steamer to rock, and it was inadvisable
to transfer them first to a rowing-boat; so an ingenious
alternative method was perfected. The tender was
brought as near the rock as possible, and the derrick boom
was swung out, so that a hook carried at the end of the rope
could be attached to the stone, which rested on rollers upon
the tender’s deck leading to an open doorway in the taffrail.
When the rope was secured, the word was given to
haul in the derrick rope slowly and gently. This brought the
stone gradually to the vessel’s side, when it was permitted
to fall into the water where it could suffer no injury. The
derrick rope meanwhile was wound in, and the stone, still
submerged, at last brought to rest against the side of the
tower.</p>

<p>A vertical series of wooden battens had been attached to
the outside of the building, so as to form a slide up which
the blocks could be hauled to the required level. Of course,
as the tower increased in height, the latter part of the operation
had to be varied, owing to the concave curve of the
structure. Then the stone had to complete its final stage
through the air, being steadied in its ascent by a rope held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
below to prevent it swinging and coming to grief against the
completed part of the shaft. In this manner 2,074 stones,
representing a dead-weight of 4,633 tons, were landed and
set in position.</p>

<p>Work was painfully slow and tedious at times, owing to
adverse weather. Although the men on the rock were condemned
inevitably to periods of idleness, they were made
as comfortable as conditions would permit, so as to remove
any longing on their part to return to the mainland for a
change. This was a necessary precaution. Although the
men might leave the rock in perfectly calm weather, the
Atlantic is so fickle that an interval of two or three hours
was quite sufficient to permit the wind to freshen, and the
swell to grow restive, to such a degree as to render a return
to the rock impossible for several days. Owing to the
cramped nature of the quarters on the rock, elaborate care
had to be exercised to protect the men from the ravages
of disease. The toilers had to board themselves, and the
authorities demanded that each man should maintain a
fortnight’s reserve supply of provisions upon the rock to
tide him over a spell of bad weather. This rule was enforced
very rigidly, any infringement of it being attended with
instant dismissal. For emergency purposes the Commissioners
maintained a small stock of salt beef, pork, tinned
meats, tea, sugar, milk, biscuits, and so forth, on the rock,
from which the men could replenish their larders. The
foreman acted as a kind of medical officer of health, as well
as fulfilling his other duties. He was supplied with a ship’s
medicine-chest, plenty of bandages, liniment, and antiseptics,
in case of accident. At five o’clock every morning
the men were compelled to tumble out of their bunks, to
indulge in a thorough wash, to turn their bedding into the
air when the weather was agreeable, and to wash out their
quarters. The strictest supervision was maintained over
matters pertaining to sanitation, and, thanks to these
elaborate precautions, cases of sickness were very few.</p>

<p>Extreme care was observed in the building operations,
so that no workman might be exposed to any unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
risks, although the task at times bristled with unavoidable
perils. As a matter of fact, the whole enterprise was
attended by only three accidents on the rock. One man
was cutting a tram-rail, when a piece of steel flew into one
eye, completely blinding it. Another suffered a similar
calamity from a chip of stone while quarrying. The third
man met misfortune while at work at the windlass of the
derrick. As a breaker rolled in, his companion dropped his
handle, with the result that the other workman was knocked
down and had one leg broken. There was a true Hibernian
flavour about this last-named accident, in keeping with the
setting in which it occurred. The man was incapacitated
for some months, and then brought an action for compensation,
claiming that he had been rendered unfit for any
further manual labour. The sympathetic court solaced
him with an award of £350, or $1,750. The amazement and
disgust of the engineer may be imagined when, three months
after the action, he suddenly espied the supposedly totally
incapacitated workman assisting in the transference of coal
from a barge to the tender!</p>

<p>THE FASTNET, THE OUTPOST OF EUROPE.</p>

<p class="captionl">On the top of the rock is the first light, opened in 1854. At the side is the present noble tower,
completed in 1906. The flashing beam of 750,000 candle-power has a range of 20 miles.</p></div></div>

<p>As the tower grew above the existing building, which it
was to exceed in height, it obscured the light thrown from
the latter in a certain direction. At this juncture, accordingly,
a temporary scaffolding was erected upon the summit
of the new shaft, on which were rigged two ordinary lightship
lights, and these were kept going until the new lantern
was completed. The last stone was set on June 3, 1903,
after some four years’ labour.</p>

<p>During the winter everything was brought virtually to a
standstill, owing to the succession of gales, but the men on
the rock never missed an opportunity to advance the undertaking.
Kavanagh, the foreman, absolutely refused to go
ashore so long as any work could be completed. Often he
remained on the Fastnet the whole year round, and never
was away for more than two months in the year, when
work was impossible. Other workmen, when they had
lived down the first feelings of loneliness, became imbued
with the same spirit, and appeared loth to forsake the scene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
of their labours even for a day or two. When the men
settled down to their toil, it was very seldom that a wish
was expressed to be taken ashore more than once in three
months.</p>

<p>The lantern was undertaken directly the stonework was
completed. The landing of this apparatus was an exciting
task, for, the season being advanced, it was decided to
run unusual risks, lest the rock should become unapproachable.
It was accomplished successfully, and the various
parts were stored on the rock in what was considered a safe
place. The weather looked fine and gave no signs of
breaking; yet two hours after all had been inspected and
secured for the night a terrific gale sprang up, and the rock
was enveloped in water, which dashed right over it. The
waves caught some of the lantern apparatus and smashed
it; other parts were carried away and never seen again.
This was an unexpected catastrophe. The remaining
damaged parts of the apparatus were sent back to Birmingham
to be overhauled and the missing portions replaced.</p>

<p>As there was no possibility of being able to complete the
lantern that winter, and the authorities did not like to
entrust the marking of the rock solely to the temporary
lightship lights&mdash;the lantern of the Halpin tower had been
taken down meanwhile&mdash;it was thereupon decided to erect
the dismantled old lamp in the new tower for the time
being.</p>

<p class="captionc">It consists of two tiers each of four panels of 920 millimetres focal distance.</p></div></div>

<p>The next summer the new apparatus was got on to the
rock and erected safely. The light is of the dioptric type,
derived from a series of incandescent burners, giving a total
power of 1,200 candles. This part of the installation is the
invention of the chief engineer to the Commissioners, Mr.
C.&nbsp;W. Scott, and it has proved to be one of the most perfect
and economical devices of this type yet submitted to practical
operations. The oil is vaporized by being passed
through a spraying device under pressure, similar to the
forced carburation in automobile practice, and the gas is
fed to the Bunsen burners. The lenses, together with their
revolving apparatus, weigh 13,440 pounds, and rotate upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
a bed of mercury under the fall of a weight of 290 pounds,
which descends 40 feet per hour, this being sufficient to
secure three complete revolutions per minute. In case the
incandescent gas installation should break down from any
cause, a four-wick oil-burner is held in reserve, and can be
brought into action instantly. The power of the rays
thrown from the 1,200 candle-power burners is intensified
by the lenses to some 750,000 candle-power, of extremely
white brilliancy, recalling the beam thrown by an electric
searchlight. The flash, of three-twenty-fifths of a second’s
duration, recurs every five seconds, and on a clear night the
light is readily distinguishable from a distance of twenty
miles, while its reflection in the sky may be observed from a
considerably greater distance.</p>

<p>The erection of this lighthouse was not without one
humorous incident. While the lantern apparatus was being
set in position, a plumber was sent to the rock. He spent
one day and night there, a period that proved to be more
than enough for him. The murmuring of the waves lost
all their musical glamour for him when he was imprisoned
on a wild, isolated, wind-and-wave-swept eyrie. He did
not get a wink of sleep, and was scared nearly out of his
wits. When morning broke, and the men were turned out
of their bunks, the plumber expressed his fixed determination
to return to the shore at once. His companions laughed
at his fears, ridiculed his anxieties, coaxed and upbraided
him in turn. It was of no avail. He would not do another
stroke of work. Realizing the hopelessness of such a workman,
the engineer in charge signalled the mainland for
assistance. The steamer could not put out, but the lifeboat,
not understanding the import of such an unusual call,
made the dangerous pull to the rock, to ascertain what was
the matter. When they found that it was to take off a
scared workman, their feelings may be imagined. The
demoralized plumber was bundled into the lifeboat and
rowed back to shore. The blood did not return to his face,
nor did he collect his scattered wits, until he planted his
two feet firmly on the mainland, when he very vehemently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and picturesquely expressed his determination never to
accept a job in such a forsaken place again.</p>

<p>The old tower was reduced to the level of its solid base,
and converted into an oil-store. The finishing touches were
applied to the new tower, and on June 27, 1906, the scintillating
and penetrating ray of the present Fastnet was shown
for the first time. It is a magnificent light, and, being the
latest expression of British lighthouse engineering upon a
large scale, compels more than passing interest. The light
is fully in keeping with the importance of the spot it marks,
and the £84,000, or $420,000, which it cost has been laid
out to excellent purpose. The light and fog-signal station
is tended by six keepers, four being on the rock simultaneously,
and two ashore. The latter constitute the relief,
which is made twice a month if the weather permits, the
service being one month on the rock, followed by a fortnight
on shore. One keeper has day duty, maintaining a
lookout for fog and to signal passing ships; two are on
duty at night, the one having charge of the light and its
operation, while his comrade devotes his attention to signalling
ships and watching the weather. When a mist creeps
over the light, the fourth keeper is called up to manipulate
the explosive fog-signal. The lighthouse, being an important
landfall, is a signalling-station for Lloyd’s, and is also fitted
with wireless telegraphy, wherewith the movements of outgoing
and incoming vessels are reported to the mainland
for notification to all parts of the world.</p>

<span class="subhead">LIGHTHOUSES BUILT ON SAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While the greater number of the most famous sea-lights
have been erected upon the solid foundation offered by
rock, in one or two instances notable works have been consummated
upon sand. The two most remarkable achievements
in this particular field of enterprise are the Rothersand
lighthouse, off the coast of Germany, in the North
Sea, and the Fourteen Foot Bank, in Delaware Bay, U.S.A.</p>

<p>The Rothersand light became necessary owing to the
expansion of the German mercantile marine and the development
of the ports of the Weser and Elbe. The estuary of
the Weser River is hemmed in by shoals and sandbanks,
similar to those found at the entrance to Liverpool, London,
and New York, rendering navigation extremely hazardous
under the most favourable circumstances. Bremerhaven,
on the Weser, had been selected as the home port for the
North German Lloyd Atlantic liners, but it was threatened
with abandonment unless the entrance to the waterway
should undergo improvement. It was of no avail to dredge
a deep channel through the treacherous ridges of sand, if
the general proximity of the shoal were left unmarked.
Consequently, in order to secure the interests of Bremerhaven,
it was decided by the three border States&mdash;Prussia,
Oldenburg, and Bremen&mdash;to provide a powerful light at
this danger-point. The financial problem was solved by
the agreement to levy a special tax upon all vessels entering
the Weser, to defray the cost of providing the safeguard.</p>

<p>The undertaking was somewhat formidable. The shoal,
being of soft sand, was liable to erosion and movement,
owing to fluctuating and changing currents. Then, again,
the proposed site, some thirty miles from Bremerhaven and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
about halfway between that port and the island of Heligoland,
was exposed to the assaults of the North Sea, where
even slight breezes ruffle the water considerably. From the
soundings and observations that were made, it was evident
that the foundations would have to be carried down to a
great depth, and that ordinary systems of construction
were quite impracticable. At this juncture the Society
Harkort of Duisburg, which had accumulated great experience
in subaqueous work, was approached and asked if
it would undertake the enterprise at its own risk. This was
tantamount to a “no cure, no pay” proposal. If they
succeeded, they would be rewarded for their labours; if
they failed, they would have to face a heavy loss.</p>

<p>This firm, after careful deliberation, allowed that the
work could be accomplished, but in one way only. This
was to construct a huge caisson&mdash;practically a gigantic
barrel of steel&mdash;on shore, to launch and tow it to the site,
and there to lower it until it rested on the bottom. Then,
by a removal of the sand from beneath this caisson, it could
be sunk to a great depth, and, the interior being filled with
concrete, a huge artificial core of rock would be created,
capable of supporting a tower. This system is employed
extensively in connection with bridge-building operations,
and the firm entertained no doubts concerning its feasibility
at Rothersand. The society accordingly prepared
its designs, and advanced an estimate for the cost of the
work.</p>

<p>At this juncture an unexpected competitor appeared on
the scene. One of the engineers engaged in the preparation
of the Harkort designs severed his connection with that firm,
and, securing the collaboration of two engineering colleagues,
established a rival concern, which tendered for the contract.
They would follow the same lines, but would complete it
for £22,750, or $113,750, instead of £24,025, or $120,125,
asked by the Duisburg firm. The lower price was accepted,
the more readily since it included the foundations, whereas
the Society Harkort set these down as an extra. Naturally,
the society was somewhat chagrined at this turn of events,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
after all the trouble and care it had taken to discover the
most satisfactory solution of the problem, but subsequently
it had good reason not to regret its loss.</p>

<p>The new engineers set to work and during the winter of
1880–81 constructed a huge caisson, which was launched
and on May 22 of the latter year started down the Weser in
charge of tugs. Then came a whole string of accidents.
One night the unwieldy fabric got adrift and drove its nose
into a sandbank, where it settled down with the tide. The
towing cables were attached once more, and after a great
struggle the structure was extricated on the next high-tide,
and resumed its journey. Reaching the site without further
incident, it was lowered by admitting the water within the
barrel. But this task being accomplished somewhat crudely,
the water rushed in with such force that the caisson commenced
to spin round like a top, as well as bobbing up and
down like an angler’s float. It threatened to topple over
and founder every moment, but, luckily keeping upright,
finally touched bottom. Lowering was completed. Night
having approached, workmen made themselves comfortable
on the caisson, while the constructional steamer stood
off and cast its anchor.</p>

<p>The men on the caisson, however, experienced one of the
most sensational nights in their lives. As the tide rose,
they found their novel home to be behaving somewhat
curiously. It moved, and then heeled over. This was an
alarming state of affairs, especially as the list gradually
became worse and worse. They shouted frantically for
help, but, a heavy fog having descended upon the shoal,
their cries were absorbed by the white pall. At last the
caisson careened over to such a degree that the men could
not keep their feet, while the depressed edge was in danger
of being submerged. The men crawled to the opposite or
elevated side, and held on for their lives, expecting every
moment that the structure would give a heave and roll over.
It was a terribly anxious time for them, and at last, when
the constructional steamer came alongside in the morning,
they scuttled down the ropes from their perilous perch to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
deck below, thankful for having escaped, as they thought,
a certain watery grave.</p>

<p>The engineers spared no effort to save their work. They
were harassed at every tide because the water rose above
the depressed edge and flooded the interior. With all
speed the wall at this point was increased in height, so as to
prevent inundation. Then, stormy weather having cut
away the sand under the elevated side, the structure
gradually righted itself. When it had regained its vertical
position, it was found that no serious damage had been
done, but rather that the engineers had profited, inasmuch
as the caisson had buried itself some 16 feet into the sand.</p>

<p>Winter was approaching, and so the engineers crowded on
every man and effort possible, in order to get the structure
sunk to the requisite level before work would have to be
abandoned for the season. They departed from the
engineer’s axiom, “Make haste slowly,” and paid the
penalty. When the bad weather broke, compelling the
return of all the workmen to shore, the fabric was left
insecure. The lower part had been given its filling of
concrete, but above a certain level the fabric depended
only upon the iron shell of the cylinder. It was stiffened
as much as possible with cross-timbers and bracing, but the
elements soon made short work of this puny defence. The
North Sea, in common with the other large stretches of
water throughout the world, was swept by terrible storms
that winter, and one morning, when the sea was scanned
from shore through glasses, strange to say the caisson was
nowhere to be seen. All sorts of rumours were circulated
to account for its disappearance, among others being a
sensational theory that the caisson, having reached swampy
ground while being sunk, had simply dropped suddenly into
the submarine quagmire, and had been swallowed up completely.
But the divers, when they could get out to the site
and could venture into the ocean depths, returned to the
surface with a very different story. The waves had snapped
off the top of the caisson at the upper level of the concrete
within, and had carried it away. Thus ended summarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the first attempt to build a lighthouse upon the red sand
at the entrance to the River Weser.</p>

<p class="captionc">This magnificent light marks a dangerous shoal in the estuary of the Weser. The masonry tower is built upon a massive concrete caisson driven
deeply into the sand.</p></div></div>

<p>The project, however, was not abandoned. The Society
Harkort was approached once more, and requested to undertake
the work upon its own terms. The invitation was
accepted, but the firm, realizing the abnormal risks incidental
to the enterprise, revised their price, so as to provide
for contingencies. It demanded a sum of £42,650, or
$213,250, in return for which it undertook to supply a
fully-equipped lighthouse less the illuminating apparatus.
The terms were accepted, but the responsible authorities,
having suffered a heavy loss from the first failure, decided
to protect themselves against a similar disaster, so exacted
a bond for £12,000, or $60,000, to be returned when the
work should be completed and accepted by the Government.
The Society Harkort, on its part, reserved the right to
withdraw from the undertaking in the event of the caisson
sharing the fate which overtook the first structure.</p>

<p>The contracts were signed in September, 1882, and the
task was commenced. The first disaster was a blessing in
disguise, for the new engineers were able to turn the mistakes
of their predecessors to advantage. They designed a
caisson of oval shape, with pointed ends, measuring 46 feet
in length by 36 feet wide. It was an elaborate, staunch
structure, towering to a height of 60¾ feet when launched.
At a height of 8 feet from the bottom edge was a massive
flooring built of iron. The space below constituted the
area in which the men were to work upon the sea-bed,
excavating the sand under compressed air, while the lower
rim was a cutting edge, so as to facilitate the sinking of the
mass as the sand was removed. The upper part of the
caisson was divided into four floors, each of which was set
aside for a specific purpose. The lowest was the concrete-mixing
chamber; that above carried the machinery and
boilers; the third floor formed the living-quarters for the
men who worked and slept on the structure; while the top
floor formed a deck, and carried two powerful cranes
whereby the material was lifted from the boats which drew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
alongside. Of course, when the caisson had been lowered
into the water and was eating its way deeper and deeper
into the sand, these platforms had to be moved higher and
higher from time to time, as the base of the tun became
filled with concrete, the outer walls of the fabric being
increased to keep the top well above high-water mark.</p>

<p>When the caisson was completed on shore and sent into
the water, it was an impressive-looking monster. The shell
itself weighed 245½ tons, and with the various accessories
aboard the weight was brought up to some 335 tons. It
then had to be loaded down to the required depth for towing,
for which purpose ballast in the form of pig-iron,
concrete, and bricks, to the extent of another 245 tons, was
stowed aboard, while delicate precautions were taken to
maintain stability. The combined efforts of 120 men,
working day and night for 127 days, were required to erect
this caisson, and on April 1, 1883, it was ready for its
transportation to the site.</p>

<p>The towing operation was extremely difficult, and the
voyage out was full of exciting incident. It was possible
to advance only on the ebb-tide, and the towing cables,
5 inches in diameter, were specially manufactured for the
operation. Two of the most powerful tugs owned by the
North German Lloyd Steamship Company were requisitioned,
three other steamers engaged in the conveyance of
requirements between tower and shore accompanying the
procession. Although the engineers were ready, the weather,
with aggravating persistence, refused to clear sufficiently to
produce the smooth sea and calm demanded for the safe
journey of the ungainly craft. Day after day slipped by,
with eighty men on the alert, and with fires banked and
steam raised on the vessels, ready to weigh anchor at the
first favourable moment. Fifty-five days passed before the
weather bureau recommended that the conditions were
suitable. Under the foregoing circumstances the expense
of this delay may be realized.</p>

<p>Directly the intimation was conveyed that the tow could
be attempted, there was a scene of indescribable activity and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
bustle in the Bremerhaven dock, where the caisson was
moored. Full steam was raised on the tugs, and at half-past
three in the morning of May 26 the mighty steel barrel
moved out of the dock. The towing ropes were hitched
on, and very slowly the “Colossus,” as the caisson was
named, moved down the harbour, accompanied by the
whole fleet of nine vessels engaged in construction work,
so that the procession was imposing. It dropped down the
river without incident, when, the tide turning, anchor was
cast, and all was made fast until another advance could be
made at four o’clock in the afternoon. But the rising tide
was stronger than had been anticipated, and trouble was
soon encountered. The caisson, pressed by the current,
dragged and strained at the two tugs by which she was
being towed, causing them to slip their anchors. It was
an anxious moment. The two vessels could not hold the
“Colossus”; in fact, they were being towed backwards by
it. Hurriedly another tug was called up, and helped in the
effort; but although the three steamers put on full steam
ahead, they failed to keep the mass in check. Another tug
was signalled, and then, under the combined effort of 350
horse-power, driving for all it was worth against the current,
the four vessels mastered the swing of the scurrying water,
and had the “Colossus” under control.</p>

<p>A little later the procession continued on its way to the
North Sea, but when the boats came up with the Hoheweg
lighthouse further disquieting news was received. The
keepers signalled that the barometer was falling, and that
a thunderstorm was hurrying across the North Sea from
England. Anchors were thrown out hurriedly, and everything
made snug and tight for the approaching storm. It
burst with fearful severity. The waves got up, the wind
blew with fiendish velocity in terrifying gusts, and the rain
tumbled down in sheets. The engineers were on tenterhooks
the whole hour and a half the storm raged, as they
foresaw lively times if the unmanageable hulk broke loose.
But the “Colossus” rode the gale as quietly as if moored
to a wharf in dock. The storm, however, upset all calculations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
for the day. There was no possibility of getting the
caisson out and sunk before nightfall, so the engineers prepared
to pass the night at anchor, and to start off again
with the dawn. The weather, ruffled by the thunderstorm,
refused to settle down until a further day and night had been
wasted. Then, at 7.30 in the morning, on a favourable
tide, anchors were weighed, and, steaming hard through a
broken sea, the tugs conveyed the caisson on its journey.
At last the procession reached the buoy marking the site.
The caisson was brought to rest, the water was admitted
gently through the valves, and slowly, steadily, and vertically,
the shell sank lower and lower, until a scarcely
perceptible shock conveyed the intimation that it had
touched bottom.</p>

<p>The most anxious part of the task was consummated with
complete success: the caisson had been got to the site and
sunk. Then the task of burying it deeply and irremovably
in the sand was hurried forward. Workmen descended into
the space beneath the bottom floor and the sea-bed. Under
compressed air they excavated the sand within the area
to permit the cutting edge to sink lower and lower. The
sand, as removed, was lifted to the top of the “Colossus”
and discharged overboard. Meanwhile the concrete-mixing
machine got busy, and the stone heart of the tun was
fashioned rapidly. Under this increasing weight the sinking
operation was assisted very appreciably. By the middle
of October the work had been advanced to such a stage that
the total weight of the structure had been increased to over
3,350 tons, and the top deck of the caisson, which had grown
in height by the attaching of successive rings of plates,
was about 99 feet above the cutting edge, which had buried
itself to a depth of 51 feet below low-water. Then work
had to be abandoned, as the autumnal gales sprang up.
The whole of the staff, with the exception of two men, who
mounted guard over the work, were taken back to Bremerhaven.
The gales increased in fury, culminating in a tempest
similar to that which had destroyed the first caisson. Remembering
the fate of that enterprise under such fearful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
pounding from wind and wave, the Harkort engineers
naturally were somewhat anxious concerning the welfare
of their handiwork under identical conditions. But the
new creation was overwhelmingly strong where its predecessor
was weak, although the seas, baffled in their efforts
to upset the caisson, did not fail to leave their mark by
knocking the superstructure and scaffolding about somewhat,
as well as carrying away a few weighty pieces of the
top hamper.</p>

<p>Work was resumed in February, 1884, and continued
more or less regularly until November. Interruptions were
of frequent occurrence, so that only about one-quarter of
the time available could be turned to useful account. The
structure which had been towed out of Bremerhaven a year
previously had disappeared from sight, the rim of the barrel
built on dry land being about 4 feet below water; but, of
course, as the work proceeded and the caisson sank, its walls
were extended upwards, as already explained. When the
structure had been sunk to its designed depth, the steel shell
was 107½ feet in height, from the cutting edge to the top
projecting above the water, and nearly 40 feet of its height
was buried in the Rothersand. To sink it to this level
required the removal of 3,000 cubic yards of sand from beneath
the bottom floor of the structure; while 49,100 tons
of material were brought out from Bremerhaven and built
into the steel shell to render it a solid elliptical mass, with
the exception of a short central hollow space which has
a narrow conduit connection with the outer sea, and which,
fitted with a float, acts as a tide-gauge which may be read
in the lighthouse. From this massive concrete pedestal rises
the tower proper, which at the base is circular, with a
diameter of 33¾ feet. This base rises in the form of a graceful
concave curve to a height of 26 feet, and is solid except
for two water-tanks. At the entrance level the tower is
23 feet in diameter. Above this are disposed four floors,
comprising the cellar, storeroom, kitchen, and living-quarters
for the men, crowned by the lantern, the gallery of which is
80½ feet above low-water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
The external appearance of this interesting lighthouse is
somewhat different from the general conception of such a
building. Instead of being merely a circular top and lantern,
there are three semicircular turret-like projections on the
dwelling-room and lantern levels, which serve for directing
and warning lights as well as for a lookout station.</p>

<p>The fickle character of the North Sea where it rolls over
the Rothersand is reflected by an experience which befell
the Harkort engineer and the superintendent of erection
for the authorities, who wished to complete his duty of
inspection. The finishing touches were being applied, a
squad of twelve workmen being in the tower to continue
the work during the winter. The early December day was
fair and the sea smooth, as well as giving every indication
of remaining quiescent for some hours. The superintendent
had arranged to spend his Christmas holidays with some
friends, and desired to complete his duty in good time, so
that his sojourn might be free from care. The two started
off in the steamer, and landed without effort. But while
they were engaged in their work of inspection the wind
and sea freshened, so that a boat could not be sent from
the steamer to take them off. It was an amusing situation
which was keenly enjoyed at Bremerhaven; but all would
be right on the morrow, said everyone. But the next day
the weather was worse, and continued so for day after day.
When a fortnight had passed without it being possible to
succour the weather-bound engineers, amusement gave way
to anxiety, more especially as a signal was flying from the
tower which conveyed the unwelcome intelligence that one
of the workmen had fallen ill. The feelings of the superintendent
may be imagined. He had visions of spending
his Yuletide in a draughty, half-finished lighthouse tower,
where comfort was conspicuous by its absence, and where
seasonal fare such as he had been anticipating keenly was
unknown. But on December 21 the constructional engineers,
having grown impatient with the weather, sent out
one of their boats, with instructions to bring everyone
ashore at all hazards. The waves were running high and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the wind was gusty, but the steamer anchored as near the
lighthouse as she dared, and by means of her boats, which
were in momentary danger of being swamped, brought off
the two engineers as well as all the workmen except two.
The latter remained behind as a guard, and, being given a
good stock of seasonal provisions and other necessities, were
left in their splendid isolation. The superintendent, after
all, was able to enjoy his Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>The succeeding spring brought a resumption of toil, and
by September the tower was completed except for the
illuminating apparatus. One feature was observed during
construction and had to receive attention. The free swing
of the currents and tides, being obstructed by the tower,
had commenced heavy erosion, big hollows being scooped
out of the soft sea-bed around the caisson. As it was quite
possible that in the course of time this scouring might imperil
the safety of the building, protective works had to be
undertaken. These were of an elaborate character, and
comprised the sinking of mattresses, fashioned from brushwood,
around the foundations, upon which were dumped
boatloads of broken stone. This mattress had to be nearly
50 feet in width, and in some places about 15 feet in thickness.
For this protective work alone some 176,550 cubic
feet of brushwood, and 600 tons of block-stone to hold it
down, were used. These measures, however, effectually
overcame the danger of erosion.</p>

<p>On November 1, 1885, the light was shown for the first
time, and the greatest peril at the entrance to the Weser
was indicated far and wide by night and day. It was a
magnificent achievement, carried through in the face of
enormous difficulties, sensational incidents innumerable,
and upon a foundation of disaster. The lighthouse is as
firm as if it were anchored upon a solid granite rock, instead
of having its roots thrust deep into treacherous
shifting sand, and constitutes an imperishable monument
to German engineering ability; while, all things considered,
the cost was low, being only £43,400, or $217,000, in all.
The light is electric, the power being supplied from a station<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
on shore, and fed to the lighthouse through a submarine
cable; the keepers are also in submarine telegraphic communication
with the mainland.</p>

<p>When the United States set out to build a similar structure
in the spacious Delaware Bay, they were confronted
with a prospect just as forbidding, and a task in every way
as difficult, as that offered in connection with the Rothersand.
There is a dangerous shoal about twenty miles off
the land, where the Atlantic beats with furious rage, and
where vessels were apt to stick hard and fast. It was
described as “Fourteen Foot Bank” by mariners, from the
depth of the water flowing over the shoal, and this colloquialism
has provided the name for the present guardian
light. The open situation did not augur favourably for
the completion of a lighthouse at this spot, but the American
engineers were resolved to make the attempt. Accordingly,
plans were prepared for a construction upon the caisson
principle, which was the only method promising success.</p>

<p>The preliminary step was the fabrication of a caisson.
The first part was more like a raft with sides. It was about
40 feet square, 5 feet thick, and with walls 7 feet deep.
It was built of timber, the staves being 12 inches square,
and upside down&mdash;that is, with the floor uppermost&mdash;on a
building-slip, as if it were a ship, and was launched into the
water upon similar lines. The sides and top were lined,
so as to secure water-tightness. In the centre there was a
circular space 5 feet in diameter to form the air-shaft.</p>

<p>As the structure was built upside down, the rim was
brought to the lowermost position, and this formed the
cutting edge, which was to be sunk into the sand. On
this floating platform a circular iron cylinder was erected.
This tube was 35 feet in diameter, and was built up in
plates, 6 feet in width by 1½ inches thick. When three
rings of iron were set up the cylinder was 18 feet in height.
In order to sink it to a depth of 15½ feet into the water for
towing purposes, it was charged with a layer of concrete,
9 inches in thickness, to serve as ballast, and in this condition
the caisson weighed 400 tons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
This huge barrel was built at Lewes, Delaware, and when
it was launched two powerful steam-tugs set out to drag it
to the shoal, twenty miles away. As the tide rises and falls
a matter of 6 feet in these waters, and the currents are somewhat
wicked, the engineers displayed no undue haste.
They waited for the first favourable opportunity, and seized
it. But it took the two tugs some six hours to reach the
site; an average speed of about three and a half miles per
hour cannot be construed into fast travelling.</p>

<p>When the mighty caisson had been warped and nudged
dead into position over the desired spot, water was admitted.
With a gurgling and hissing the hulk sank slowly into the
sea. At last a slight jolt, which quivered through the mass,
signified that the structure was resting on the bottom. The
engineers gave a sigh of relief, but the next instant changed
it to a cry of dismay. The caisson began to heel over to
one side. Was it going to capsize? That was the absorbing
fear. It canted more and more, until at last it had a list of
12 degrees. <em>It had not sunk vertically!</em> There was less
than 16 inches of water between the sea-level and the rim
when the caisson first jarred against the sand, and if it
careened over too far the water certainly would rush in,
roll the whole tub over, and tumble it hither and thither
over the sea-bed. The engineers watched that caisson as
closely as a cat watches a mouse-hole. Presently it eased
up, and then, as the tide rose some six hours later, it began
to right itself. The engineers were relieved once more. The
danger was over. But their self-satisfaction was soon upset
as the tide began to ebb, because again the cylinder gradually
fell over on its side. The cause of this strange behaviour
flashed upon them. The surface of the sandbank was not
level! The mass in sinking had touched bottom on the
highest point of the shoal, and was trying to find its own
level.</p>

<p>Without any further delay, the engineers decided upon an
ingenious means of correcting this erratic and dangerous
action. The tugs were despatched hurriedly to Lewes to
bring out cargoes of broken stone, which had been delivered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
for the preparation of the concrete. While the steamers
pursued their errand, the engineers fashioned large pockets
on the elevated section of the structure, into which the stone
upon its arrival was placed. Gradually but surely the
caisson not only was corrected, but the weighted end was
induced to settle into the sand, until the opposite free edge
in its turn was resting upon the shoal.</p>

<p>In this manner all danger of further canting now was
removed. As the rim had been brought perilously near the
water-level, and there was a possibility of flooding from a
rough sea, the walls of the caisson were extended vertically
with all haste; meanwhile two additional rings of iron were
placed in position, and the top was brought about 20 feet
above the water. While this work was in progress the
structure gradually bit farther and farther into the sand,
until at last it secured a firm hold.</p>

<p>At the earliest possible moment the air-compressors were
set to work, and air was driven into the space between the
cutting edge and the roof, in which the men were to work.
This space was 40 feet square and 7 feet deep. The greater
pressure of the air drove the water out from this space,
and the men were able to enter through the air-lock and to
work upon a dry surface, isolated from the surrounding sea
by the fence formed by the cutting edge.</p>

<p>The men toiled in eight-hour shifts continuously, removing
the sand within the space and sending it upwards
to be discharged overboard. As the area was excavated,
the cutting edge sank deeper and deeper, so that the
structure became more and more firmly embedded. There
was apprehension that the obstruction offered by the caisson
to the movement of the currents might set up undermining
around the cylinder, as in the case of the Rothersand; but
the engineers arrested any tendency in this direction by
dumping large pieces of stone overboard around the tub.
Some 6,000 tons of stone were used for this purpose, so that
the caisson has an impregnable protection.</p>

<p>As the structure sank lower and lower, owing to the
excavation, concrete was dumped around the air-tube above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the floor of the space in which the men were labouring, while
successive rings of iron were added to the top of the cylinder.
The men worked with great gusto in their novel situation,
and, the task being prosecuted uninterruptedly throughout
the day and night, the cylinder sank from 12 to 24 inches
during the twenty-four hours. This labour was maintained
until the cutting edge of the caisson was 33 feet below the
surface of the shoal, when the engineers called halt. They
considered that the task had been continued to a sufficient
depth to secure the requisite rigidity for their lighthouse.
The men left the working chamber, which was then tightly
underrammed with sand, so as to form a solid foundation,
while the air-shaft was filled up with rammed sand and
sealed with a thick plug of concrete. The wall of the iron
cylinder had been intermittently increased in height by the
addition of successive rings of plates, until the rim was
70 feet above the cutting edge and projected about 30 feet
above the water at low-tide. From the bottom to a height
of 40 feet it is virtually a solid mass of concrete, protected by
a skin of iron 1½ inches thick. Further concrete was added,
bringing the solid section to within 10 feet of the rim, so
that the concrete heart is about 53 feet in height and 35 feet
in diameter. It is a solid circular rock sunk into the sand,
and as firm and free from vibration as a granite core.</p>

<p>Upon this foundation a house for the light-keepers,
crowned by a tower, was erected, the focal plane being 59 feet
above mean high-water. It is fitted with a light of the
fourth order, visible for thirteen miles.</p>

<p>One of the most important features in connection with
the Fourteen Foot Bank light was its small cost, which was
below the estimate, especially when it is compared with
the German work. The United States Government appropriated
a sum of £35,000, or $175,000, for the undertaking,
but the total expenditure was less than £25,000, or $125,000,
so that a sum of £10,000, or $50,000, was handed back to
the Treasury&mdash;a most unusual event in connection with
Government contracts. The lighthouse was finished and
brought into service in 1886.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
The success of this novel enterprise prompted the authorities
to essay a more daring project&mdash;the erection of a lighthouse
upon the caisson principle on the Outer Diamond
Shoal, off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. But the storms
encountered off this inhospitable coast have proved too
overpowering for the engineer. Numerous attempts have
been made, but disaster has been their invariable fate.
The Diamond Shoal refuses to be indicated by anything
except a lightship.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME LIGHT PATROLS OF THE FRENCH COAST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the matter of safeguarding its shores the French nation
has displayed considerable enterprise, and its engineers have
added some magnificent contributions to this field of
engineering. The maintenance and welfare of these aids
to navigation is placed in the hands of the Service des
Phares, which is controlled by the Department of Bridges
and Roads. The French scheme is the disposition of the
lights along the shore in such a way that their ranges overlap
on either side, so that, as one passes along the coast,
before one ray is dropped the next is picked up. Electricity
is employed extensively as the illuminant, so that the
lights are of great power and twinkle like brilliant white
stars on a clear night.</p>

<p>While the majority of these guides are erected on the
mainland, others rise from islands lying off the coast,
which, by their position in deep water, render navigation
hazardous. The finest expressions of French lighthouse
engineering are to be found along the rugged islet-dotted
coast of the huge indentation in which lie the Channel
Islands&mdash;the cruel coast of Brittany. It was off the western
extremity of Brittany, which thrusts itself well out into the
Atlantic Ocean, forming the point generally known as
Ushant, that the <i>Drummond Castle</i> lost her way, to pull
up with a fatal crash against one of the jagged reefs stretching
to seaward. While this wreck was but one of many in
these troubled waters, it sent a thrill round the world,
owing to the terrible loss of life with which it was accompanied.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the French Government
has endeavoured to remove the evil notoriety which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
this coast has reaped, and to render it as safe as the other
stretches lying to the north and south. The conditions,
however, are against the engineer, as the nose of the mainland
projects well into the ocean, and receives the full
brunt of its attacks when gales rage, so that a foothold is
precarious.</p>

<p>When the question of lighting this inhospitable stretch
of coast arose, the French authorities debated whether it
would not be easier, cheaper, and more satisfactory, to place
the lighthouses on the mainland at a sufficient altitude,
and to fit them with adequately powerful lights to indicate
the outlying reefs. The general opinion was in favour of
such a practice. So when Léonce Reynaud proposed to
mark the Heaux de Bréhat with a magnificent tower, there
was considerable opposition. The critics maintained that
it was a flagrant temptation of Fate to attempt the conquest
of such an evil wave-swept rock, the head of which was
barely visible above high-water, and was of such small
dimensions that work would be possible for only a few hours
daily and then by no more than a mere handful of men.</p>

<p>The engineer was confident that he could surmount all
difficulties in construction, and that he would be able to
erect a tower which would defy wind and wave, so he gained
the day and received the requisite sanction to proceed with
his undertaking. He had surveyed the rock and its surroundings
thoroughly; had discovered the velocity of the
currents, and their varying directions under all conditions
of weather. They tore along at about nine and a half miles
an hour, and this speed was augmented considerably in
rough weather. He selected the site for the lighthouse about
nine miles from the Isle of Bréhat, where landing would have
to be made at low-water, owing to the water rushing first
from the island to the rock, and then in the opposite direction,
according to the movements of the tides.</p>

<p>The Isle of Bréhat was made the base for operations. It
is freely indented, and one of the coves was found to form
an excellent little harbour. A rough stone jetty was run
out for a length of 170 feet, and while one fleet of boats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
was retained to convey material from the island to the rock,
another was kept to bring supplies to the island for preparation,
and the support of the men, whose quarters were established
at this depot. Sixty men were employed on the
work. They dressed the granite stones and prepared the
woodwork as it arrived in the raw condition, ample workshops
being provided for these purposes.</p>

<p>THE HEAUX DE BRÉHAT LIGHT.</p>

<p class="captionc">A striking tower built by Léonce Reynaud off the exposed Brittany coast. It is 159 feet
high and took six years to complete.</p></div></div>

<p>The face of the rock was cleaned off during the brief
intervals when it was bared by the sea, and rough stones
and masonry were laid in concrete and continued solidly
to a point 13 feet above high-water. Around this confined
platform quarters were built for the handful of men who
stayed on the rock during the periods of calm weather, as
too much time was lost in travelling to and from the island,
while there were risks of landing being interrupted by the
swell. A temporary light was also placed in position while
constructional work was proceeding, to warn navigation.
The facilities also included a small forge for the fashioning
upon the spot of the iron dogs and bolts whereby the stones
were clamped together, and this proved highly convenient,
except for one thing: when the water was somewhat rough
and playful, the waves, striking the rock, flew into the air,
soused the forge, and extinguished the fire.</p>

<p>The preparations of the foundations proved exceedingly
tedious. The rock is a very hard black porphyry, but the
surface was so scarred with fissures and deep cracks that
the whole of the upper surface had to be cleaned off, so as to
remove all rotten and splintered rock in order to secure a
firm, solid foundation. Then a circle 38 feet in diameter
was marked off, and masons cut away all the rock around
this line to a depth of about 20 inches and of sufficient
width to take the stones&mdash;a trench, as it were. This work
had to be executed during the short period of low-water,
and a special schedule was prepared to insure the men concentrating
the whole of their energies upon the task when
opportunity offered. As the ebbing tide began to bare the
space, the workmen were called, and they followed the
receding water, never leaving the spot for meals, but toiling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
continuously until the returning tide drove them off. As a
rule the men were sufficiently fleet to get clear untouched, although
they delayed their retreat until the very last moment;
but at other times the sea was a trifle quicker, and the men
received an unexpected douche from a scurrying wave.</p>

<p>When this trench had been cleared out and the face
levelled, the outer ring of stones was laid and secured firmly
in position. The inner space of the rock was left in its
roughly trimmed condition, and was then buried beneath
cement and rock to the level of the outer ring of stones,
forming a platform ready to receive the mass of the tower.
The outer ring was the main consideration, and the work
had to be finished in such a manner that a tight joint was
made with the rock, to resist the penetration of the water.
When the men were compelled to lay down their tools for
the coming tide, they hastily applied a thick covering of
quick-drying cement to the work completed, thereby protecting
it against the disintegrating and percolating action
of the sea.</p>

<p>Ere the work had started thoroughly, the engineer was
faced with a trouble which he had not anticipated. The
men were left to attend to their own desires in the way of
provisions. This haphazard arrangement had the inevitable
sequel. Some of the men were stricken down with scurvy,
and the disease promised to secure a firm hold, when the
engineer stepped in with a firm hand. He established a
canteen, the contractor of which was compelled to maintain
a supply of varied provisions for six months at least, lest
the little colony should become isolated by rough weather.
A regular varied bill of fare was imposed upon the workmen,
who were compelled to purchase their requirements
from the canteen. By this firm and timely action the
disease was stamped out. The engineer also enforced other
stringent regulations in the interests of health. The men
were compelled to bathe once a week, and had to turn their
sleeping-blankets into the open air every day; while the
quarters had to be washed out and the walls given a dressing
of limewash at frequent intervals.</p>

When the visitor approaches the tower for the first time,
he cannot fail to be impressed by its unusual design. It
appears as if a former tower of great diameter had been
decapitated, and another more slender building placed
upon its butt. This is due to the ingenious idea adopted
by Reynaud. The lower part of the tower rises like the
trunk of a tree from the base, which is a solid plinth, to a
height of 39 feet above highest spring-tides. At the top
this lower tower is 28 feet in diameter, as compared with
38 feet at the base. Here the butt is levelled off, and from
its surface rises the lighthouse proper, in the form of a
slightly tapering cone, leaving a narrow gallery around
the superimposed structure to serve as a “set-off” and
landing or entrance platform.</p>

<p>In carrying out his work, Reynaud followed a principle
quite divergent from the prevailing practice in lighthouse
construction. He did not attach every stone irremovably
to its neighbours, but merely made fast the masonry at
varying points, where the mass of water might be expected
to expend the greater part of its violence. The method he
adopted is very simple. Keystones are introduced at selected
points in each course, and these are driven up and held tight
by granite plugs and wedges. The principle was assailed at
the time as being deficient in strength, but no apprehensions
ever have arisen concerning the safety of the tower, so that
the engineer’s daring ingenuity has been completely justified.</p>

<p>Considering the isolation of the rock and its wind-swept
position, it was built in a very short time. The whole of
the year 1834 was devoted to the survey of the rock, close
observations of the prevailing meteorological conditions,
and the preparation of the design. The succeeding year
was confined to the establishment of the workmen’s quarters,
the cutting of the annular trench in the rock, and the setting
of the masonry course. The erection of the superstructure
occupied nearly four years, the work being completed and
the light exhibited in 1859, according to the inscription.
The tower is 159 feet in height, and the light has a range
of eighteen miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Since the Heaux de Bréhat was conquered so successfully,
French lighthouse engineering skill has been manifested
actively around the ill-famed Brittany coast, which now is
robbed of the greater part of its dangers. Reynaud’s work,
however, did not bring complete safety to the waters from
which it lifts its imposing form. Four miles off the self-same
island is the plateau of Horaine. This is a chain of
rocks, the greatest peril of which is that at high-tide nothing
whatever of them is seen, and their existence is betrayed
only by the agitated and broken waves rushing over them
with fearful force. As the tide falls the water becomes
more tormented, and is torn into flying foam, until,
when it has almost ebbed, these jagged fangs may be seen
projecting above the surf. Bearing in mind these terrible
characteristics, it is not surprising that time after time
vessels which had been driven out of their course by tempestuous
weather, or had got lost in a dense fog, blundered
into this death-trap and were lost.</p>

<p>The French Government was sorely puzzled as to how to
overcome this danger. The engineers fought the elements
valiantly for forty years in an effort to crown Horaine
with a beacon, but time after time they were defeated.
Landing on the reef is highly dangerous. The rocks are
surrounded by surging, eddying currents, running at anything
from six miles upwards per hour, while the slightest
ruffle of wind is quite sufficient to stir up the water so as to
fling it swirling over the rocks even at lowest tide. Once or
twice, when a period of abnormal calm prevailed, the
engineers struggled on to the rock and hurriedly built a
substantial masonry beacon, but its life was always brief.
The first two or three gales which pounded and roared over
the chain invariably scattered the handiwork of man in all
directions.</p>

<p>Then another expedient was attempted. A party landed
upon the ridge, drove a hole into the solid rock, and there
set a vertical iron girder 4 inches in thickness, trusting
that it would hold fast and indicate the reef sufficiently
during the day. But its life was short. A gale came along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
and snapped the post in twain, leaving a twisted, bent
stump, some 36 inches long, remaining on the rock.</p>

<div id="ip_154" class="figcenter" style="width: 595px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>PREPARING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE JUMENT LIGHT.</p>

<p class="captionc">This illustration conveys an idea of the difficulties encountered in connection with this work.</p></div></div>

<p>In 1890 another bold effort to subjugate the ridge was
made. An hexagonal structure was designed, and it was
determined to plant this on the rock by hook or by crook,
and so firmly as to resist the most powerful hammerings
to which it could be subjected by the waves. Six holes were
bored into the rock surface to form the corners of the
hexagon. But before commencing the work proper it was
decided to insert an iron post, 6½ inches thick, into one of
the holes, and to leave it to see what would happen. Time
after time it was inspected, and was found to be safe and
sound. Two years had slipped by, practically, since the
post was planted, and it was still intact. The engineers
thought they had triumphed, and were preparing their
plans, when the news came that a heavy storm, which had
swept the coast, had broken the pillar off flush with the
rock.</p>

<p>This necessitated another change in the designs and the
plan of campaign. After further discussion it was decided
to proceed right away with a masonry tower, although
the engineers were prepared for a mighty tussle. The
surveys showed that, as the rock upon which the building
was to be erected was covered by 10 feet of water during
the highest spring-tides, work upon the foundations would
be confined to the lowest neap-tides, when about 4 feet of
the rock were exposed. But the tide sinks to the very low
level desired infrequently&mdash;about four days in every month.
Even then work would be possible for only about an hour
per day&mdash;four hours per month! The prospect certainly
was far from being attractive, especially as even to accomplish
this meed of toil the calmest weather and smoothest
sea were imperative, and it was scarcely to be expected
that everything would be in favour of the engineers at one
and the same time.</p>

<p>Another adverse feature was only too apparent. If unpropitious
weather prevailed just after an hour or two’s
work had been completed, the chances were a thousand to one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
that it would be swept away. But this was a contingency
which had to be faced. The engineer could only do the
utmost humanly possible to secure his work, and then
must trust to luck.</p>

<p>With infinite difficulty a small corps of daring workmen
and appliances of the simplest description, together with
materials, were got out to the rock upon the first favourable
day when there was a very low tide. An outer wall of
bricks was built piecemeal, and the space within was filled
with concrete. This stood, and so the engineer secured a
level plinth upon which to place his tower. He selected an
octagonal building, the angles of which touch the circumference
of a circle 20 feet in diameter described on the rock.
It was to be 50 feet in height, bringing the warning light
about 40 feet above high-water. The beacon was to be a
concrete monolithic structure at least for the greater part
of its height, as the light was to be of the unattended class.
Accordingly, the mould was formed by setting a cast-iron
post, 18 inches in height, at each corner of the octagon,
this support being anchored into the solid rock beneath.
These posts contained grooves to admit sliding wooden
uprights, which were to be firmly wedged, these joists
being inclined to take the angle, or batter, proposed for the
tower. Heavy transverse pieces of timber were laid between
these posts, forming a capacious octagonal box, into which
the concrete was poured. As the filling process behind the
wooden wall advanced, angle pieces of steel were superimposed
and bolted up.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE JUMENT LIGHT RECENTLY ERECTED OFF USHANT.</p>

<p class="captionc">This beacon was built with a legacy left by M. Potron, a distinguished French traveller, in the interests of humanity.</p></div></div>

<p>The security of the structure occupied the sole attention
of the engineer. When work had to cease, and the boat put
off with the workmen after a spell of toil, the engineer would
watch the rising tide and the waves sweeping over his
structure, until at last it disappeared from sight. As the
tide fell he followed the receding waters just as eagerly,
and gave a sigh of relief when he saw that the tower was
still withstanding the blind forces of Nature. In the early
stages an effort to protect the work, when the men had to
retreat before the rising tide, was made by covering it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
a heavy piece of sailcloth, lashed down and weighted in
position with huge masses of pig-iron. This served its
purpose for a time, but finally the sea got the upper hand,
tore the canvas from its lashings, and carried it away,
together with the whole of its weights. Then a wooden
protective device was employed, and this likewise held out
until a particularly unfriendly September gale smashed it
to matchwood, as well as damaging the concrete slightly
here and there.</p>

<p>The men took their tools and materials with them on
every visit, and, as the tower rose, the working spells between
the tides became longer and longer, until, when a point above
high-water was reached, work was continued throughout the
day whenever the rock was approachable. A small wooden
platform was erected on one side, on which the concrete was
mixed, while on the other there was a little shelf with a small
cistern, which was filled with water from the boats below,
through the agency of a pump. A jury derrick was rigged
up to lift the material and men to the working level. As
the tower rose in height, the wooden mould had to be dismembered
and re-erected upon the new level, this operation
being repeated no less than forty times until the desired
height was gained. Work was exasperatingly slow and
intermittent, while it had to be suspended entirely for about
six or seven months, as no one dared to venture near the
rock in winter. Taken on the whole, it was one of the most
anxious and difficult pieces of the work of this character
which the French Government has ever undertaken, while
the working area was so confined that less than a dozen men
could toil simultaneously without getting in one another’s
way.</p>

<p>Recently the Brittany coast has been further protected
by another magnificent beacon, the Jument lighthouse, off
Ushant. This awful spot has long been marked by a very
powerful electric light at Creach, which may be seen over
twenty miles away, and, together with its fellow on the
opposite end of the island, may be said to guide the crowded
shipping around this promontory very effectively. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
foggy weather reduces the mariner to helplessness, as the
sea for two miles round the island is studded with reefs,
ridges and rocky humps of a very formidable character, so
that vessels have to keep well beyond this zone. When the
light is obscured, safe travelling is possible only by going very
slowly and making liberal use of the lead, while the captain
must keep a sharp eye upon the rapid currents which set
inshore if he would not be thrown upon the rocks he is seeking
sedulously to avoid.</p>

<p>The French Government, with its characteristic thoroughness,
determined to secure the complete indication of the
Ushant and all its dangers by a carefully-conceived and
comprehensive chain of lights distributed over the dangerous
area. The urgency of such a scheme is obvious when it is
remembered that it is computed that 24,000 vessels of all
classes pass Ushant in the course of the year. At the same
time the sea’s harvest of vessels and lives off this rocky
shore every year is appallingly heavy. The only handicap
to the immediate completion of the Government’s humane
project is the extreme difficulty of the work and its prodigious
cost.</p>

<p>Fortunately, through the extreme generosity of a French
traveller&mdash;M. Potron&mdash;it was rendered possible to commence
the scheme. Upon his death, and according to the terms of
his will, dated January 9, 1904, this gentleman left 400,000
francs&mdash;£16,000, or $80,000&mdash;for the erection of a lighthouse
of the latest type and with the most powerful lighting
apparatus off the coast washed by the open Atlantic, and
even suggested that a site off Ushant would be found the
most beneficial to humanity. After consultation between
his executor, residuary legatee, and the Government, a rock
known as La Jument, off the south of the Ile d’Ouessant
(Ushant) was selected for the site of his monument. The
lighthouse engineers advocated a tower 118 feet in height,
with a light of the latest type and a modern fog-signalling
apparatus. This proposal was accepted, and was sanctioned
on November 18, 1904, by the parties concerned.</p>

<p>Headquarters were established in the Bay of Lampaul, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Ushant Island, which immediately faces the site, and by
the end of 1904 the preparations were well advanced. A
steamboat, a launch and a lifeboat were secured, the first-named
for the purpose of maintaining communication with
the mainland and to bring in supplies, together with suitable
craft for transporting material and provisions to the rock.
The situation of the ledge and its exposure to the worst
weather rendered approach very difficult. The danger spot
itself is completely covered at high-tide, and only projects
4 feet at low-water. So far as the foundations were concerned,
work was only possible for a few hours at a time.
During the closing months of 1904 seventeen landings were
made and fifty-two hours in all spent upon the rock, while
in the succeeding year the men landed fifty-nine times, to
put in an aggregate of 206½ hours.</p>

<p>The current rushes round the reef with a velocity of some
ten miles per hour, varying its direction according to the
movements of the tides. Investigation proved the existence
of a small space of water on one side where the boats could
approach and moor safely in an eddy. The men were brought
out in the steamer, which also towed the launch and the lifeboat.
The latter was kept in readiness alongside the rock
while the men were at work, in case of emergency. A sharp
eye had to be kept upon the weather while the handful of
men laboured hastily preparing the face of the rock, and at
the first signs of a threatening sky or increased movement in
the swell the steamer blew its siren, the men scrambled
aboard, and were hurried back to the island.</p>

<p>The year 1906 was one of bad weather, rendering frequent
approach impossible. During this season the men landed
only thirty-nine times and toiled for 152 hours, while the sum
of their achievement was the least throughout the whole
seven years which the tower occupied in its erection. The
building is solid for about 30 feet above the rock, and in 1908
the construction of the tower proper was commenced. The
base is circular, with a diameter of 33¾ feet; but the tower
itself is of octagonal form, with a diameter at the base of
28 feet, tapering slightly to the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
One notable feature in connection with the work was the
utilization of electricity for the operation of the derrick,
which was driven by a petrol motor coupled thereto. This
was supplemented in times of pressure with another derrick,
driven by current generated on the steamer, from which a
cable trailed to the rock. Altogether 4,180 tons of masonry
were transported to the rock and set in position. During
the seven years the work was in progress, from the first
landing to the final withdrawal of the workmen, 449 landings
were made and 2,937 hours of work put in. The largest
annual aggregate of labour was in 1911, when 70 landings
were made and 400 hours turned to useful purpose. The
tower, which is of imposing appearance, has six floors for the
convenience of the keeper, stores, etc. The apartment immediately
beneath the lantern contains the fog-signalling
apparatus, which comprises a siren driven by air which is
compressed for the purpose by means of a fourteen horse-power
petrol motor. The signal is as follows: Three blasts of
one and a half seconds’ duration with intervening intervals
of one and a half seconds, followed by a silent period of fifty-two
and a half seconds, one cycle thus being emitted every
minute. The light, which is thrown from an elevation of
110¼ feet above high-water, throws groups of three red
flashes at intervals of fifteen seconds, and has a maximum
range of twenty miles in very clear weather.</p>

<p>In accordance with the terms of the donor’s will, the light
is named after the rock upon which it stands, and therefore
is known as the Jument of Ushant lighthouse. The benefactor’s
second wish is also respected in the inscription
wrought in the solid granite, which translated runs:
“This lighthouse was built with the legacy of Charles Eugène
Potron, traveller, and member of the Geographical Society
of Paris.” The sum set aside by this benefactor of humanity,
however, did not defray the entire cost of the lighthouse. As
a matter of fact, the total outlay on the undertaking was more
than twice the sum left for the purpose, totalling 850,000
francs&mdash;£34,000, or $170,000. The Government decided that
the munificence of its citizen offered the opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
carry out the first instalment of the scheme it had in view
upon the most complete lines&mdash;hence the heavy disbursement.
Nevertheless the origin of the Jument lighthouse is
almost unprecedented in the annals of lighthouse engineering,
and it probably ranks as the first important light which
has been built in accordance with the terms, and with
funds, left by a will.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GUARDIAN LIGHTS OF CANADA’S COAST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The phenomenal commercial expansion of the Dominion of
Canada, which has brought about an amazing development
in the maritime traffic with that country on both its seaboards,
naturally has been responsible for the display of
striking activity in the provision of aids to navigation. Both
the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines bristle with dangers of
a most terrible nature; the innumerable islands and precipitous
flanks of rock recall the wild ruggedness of the
western coast of Scotland or the forbidding Atlantic shoreline
of France and Spain.</p>

<p>When the ships of Britain first traded with Canadian
shores, shipwrecks and ocean tragedies were numerous;
there is no escape for a ship which is caught on those pitiless
coasts. The early settlers, therefore, did not hesitate to
provide ways and means of guiding navigators to safety.
Their first lights were primitive, comprising bonfires fed with
wood, of which ample supplies abounded, pitched on prominent
headlands; and these flickering rays, when not obscured
by smoke and fog, served to speed the ship safely on her way.</p>

<p>The British pioneers, naturally, did not hesitate to improve
upon these uncertain crude methods of warning, in course of
time, by the erection of more substantial lights. These for
the most part comprised timber-frame dwellings, used by the
family entrusted with the maintenance of the light, from the
roof of which a wooden tower extended, similar in design
to the buildings favoured for a similar purpose in the United
States. Many lights of this class are still doing faithful
service to-day, and although one might anticipate the destruction
of such a beacon from fire, yet, owing to the unremitting
care displayed by the families associated with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
upkeep thereof, this awful fiend has not been responsible for
the temporary extinction of many lights in the country’s
history.</p>

<p class="captionc">One of the finest and most powerful beacons in the world. It is filled with the hyperradiant apparatus, and the ray is of 1,100,000 candle-power.</p></div></div>

<p>One of the oldest, if not the first light to be established,
was that on Sambro Island, to indicate the entrance into
Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia. This signpost of the sea
was set up in 1758, and fulfilled its purpose for 148 years,
when it was reconstructed and fitted with the most up-to-date
appliances. The white flash now bursts forth, at an
elevation of 140 feet above mean high-water, from the top
of a white octagonal stone and concrete tower, and is visible
from a distance of seventeen miles. When it is blotted out
by fog, a powerful signal is given once every ten minutes by
a cotton-powder charge. Mariners, however, are cautioned
against attempting to make Sambro in fog, as the shore
is wild and cruel. This explosive signal is emitted rather
to communicate a timely warning to vessels which have lost
their way.</p>

<p>The two most dangerous spots in the approach to Canada,
however, lie off the mainland. One is the irregular triangular
island of Newfoundland; the other is a low-lying stretch of
sand known as Sable Island. Both are amongst the most
ill-famed graveyards in the North Atlantic, where hundreds
of ships have gone to their doom. Even to-day, although
both are well protected by lights, wrecks are by no means
uncommon. Sable Island is stalked by the ghosts of scores
of seafarers who have been the victims of some ghastly
ocean tragedy upon its banks.</p>

<p>The island of Newfoundland lies in the jaw of the River
St. Lawrence, with two narrow passages leading between
the Gulf behind and the broad Atlantic. Both straits offer
dangers to navigation, although in this respect that of
Belle Ile, whereby the northern corner of the island is
rounded, is the worse offender. Yet the most dangerous
corner of the island is, not where the waterways are hemmed
in, but that tongue which thrusts itself far out to sea, to
terminate in the bluff headland of Cape Race. This shoreline
is as serrated as a fine saw, being a succession of indentations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
and steep promontories, with submerged reefs running
far out to sea. To the south lies that great submerged
tableland, invariably curtained in fog, where mighty icebergs
that have come down from the north pound and grate
themselves to pieces, which throughout the shipping world
is regarded with dread&mdash;the Grand Banks. This south-eastward
corner of the island, by being thrust so far outwards,
brings the rocky headlands into the path of the vessels
plying between Europe, Canada, and New York.</p>

<p>The shortest route between the Old and New World
extends across the northern half of the Banks, with a slight
swing southwards to avoid Cape Race. So far as the great
liners are concerned, they are spared this peril, inasmuch
as their prescribed lanes give the cruel coast a wide berth;
but all other shipping has either to swing round the headland
to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or strike farther north and
pass through the Strait of Belle Ile. The latter route, however,
is available for only five months in the year; the greater
volume of the traffic skirts the southern shores of the island.</p>

<p class="captionc">This is a typical example of a wooden frame building. The tower projects from the roof of the home of the lighthouse-keeper
and his family.</p></div></div>

<p>Under these circumstances Cape Race is to the western
side of the Atlantic what the Fastnet and Bishop Rocks are
to the eastern boundaries of this ocean. Even if the wild
character of the coast were not sufficient justification for
a light, the currents experienced off these shores, which are
of high velocity and violently broken up by the indentations
and protuberances, would demand the provision of a beacon.
Over one hundred vessels of all descriptions have been
smashed to pieces in the vicinity of Cape Race alone. The
Allan liner <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> crashed into the cliffs and went
down in 1864 with 290 souls. In this instance the death-roll
would have been far heavier had it not been for the
pluck and grit of the lighthouse-keepers, who, observing the
wreck, hurried to the water’s edge, lowered themselves with
ropes from the heights above, and, stumbling, groping, and
feeling their way through the darkness, at imminent risk
to their own limbs and lives, rescued 130 of the luckless
passengers and crew from the wreck, who were huddled on a
ledge under the cliffs, hungry, shivering with cold, and too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
exhausted to assist themselves. The light-keepers and men
from the telegraph-station had to lift these helpless survivors
one by one to the top of the precipice, a task demanding
herculean effort, patience, and intrepidity, and to lead
and help them to the lighthouse, where they were tended
until a steamer, answering the telegraphic call for help, came
round from St. John’s and took the hapless people off.</p>

<p>In 1901 the <i>Assyrian</i> ran ashore in calm weather, and was
too firmly jammed on a reef to extricate herself. A week
later another fine vessel and cargo worth £80,000, or $400,000,
was battered to pulp by the waves, the lighthouse-keepers
once more, at great risk to themselves, putting out and
rescuing those on board in the nick of time. Ere the excitement
of this wreck had died down, a French emigrant steamer,
the <i>Lusitania</i>, ran full-tilt on to a reef, and but for the
timely aid rendered by the lighthouse-keepers and the
fisherfolk 550 people would have been drowned. More
fearful catastrophes have been enacted within hail of the
lights at Cape Race and Cape Ray, hard by to the west, and
more millions sterling of cargo and ship have been shattered
and lost here than upon any other corresponding
stretch of coast in the world. The most noticeable point in
connection with these disasters is the large number of big
boats which have ended their careers abruptly off this spot,
although the rocks have claimed a big share of small fry
as well.</p>

<p>The first beacon was placed on the headland in 1856. It
was a cylindrical tower, built up of cast-iron plates, erected
near the edge of the cliff, which is 87 feet high. The tower
itself being 38 feet in height, the focal plane of the beam
was at an elevation of 125 feet above the sea. It was
erected jointly by the British and Newfoundland Government
authorities, although the maintenance thereof was
entrusted to Great Britain. In return for the provision of
this warning, a tax of one-sixteenth of a penny, or an eighth
of a cent, per ton, was collected in England from vessels
passing the light. The beacon was not particularly powerful,
the ray being only of some 6,000 candle-power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Some years ago the lighthouse was handed over to the
Canadian Government to be included in its service, together
with the balance of the fund which had accrued from the
levy of the special tax. This sum represented £20,579, or
$102,895. The Canadian Government abolished the light-due,
and the surplus funds were absorbed into the general
revenue of the country.</p>

<p>The new owners, realizing the importance of the light,
subsequently decided to provide a new beacon of greater
power to meet the demands of shipping, which had increased
amazingly. In 1907 this structure was completed. It is
a cylindrical tower, carried out in reinforced concrete,
100 feet in height, surmounted by a lantern of the first order
with hyperradial apparatus. This is the largest type of
optical apparatus in use at the present time, and the ray of
light produced by an incandescent oil-burner and mantle
is of 1,100,000 candle-power, shed from an elevation of
195 feet above the water. The warning flash of a quarter
of a second every seven and a half seconds is visible from a
distance of nineteen miles. In addition, the fog-signalling
apparatus was brought up to date. The steam-whistle,
which had sufficed up to the date of reconstruction, was
replaced by a diaphone of the greatest power installed up
to that time. This is set up about 250 feet south of the
lighthouse, with which it is connected by a covered passage.
The air required to emit the warning blast, lasting three and
a half seconds once in every half-minute, is compressed by
the aid of steam. By day the lighthouse is readily distinguishable
from its red and white vertical stripes, red
lantern, and white dwelling with red roof, in which the
keepers have their quarters. To-day the station ranks as
one of the finest in the world, complying in every respect
with the requisitions for one of a first-class character.</p>

<p>Sable Island is perhaps an even more evil spot in the
North Atlantic than the ill-famed Newfoundland coast.
It is a bleak, inhospitable, crescent-shaped collection of
sand-dunes, eighty-five miles due east of Nova Scotia and
lying right in the steamship tracks. A more uninviting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
stretch of dry land could not be conceived. Little grows
here beyond a special kind of brush, which appears to
flourish in sea-swept billows of sand. But the obstacle is
formidable, being twenty-two miles in length by a mile in
width at its broadest part. This does not constitute the
extent of its dangers&mdash;far from it. The island is slowly but
surely being swallowed up by the restless, hissing sea, with
the result that, when one stands on the almost indistinguishable
line where sea meets land, an aspect of white ruffs of
foam curl in all directions as far as the eye can see, where the
surf is thundering over the shoals. I have related the toll
that this island of the dead has exacted from shipping,<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> and
now confine myself to describing the means that have been
provided to warn the mariner off its bars. The Canadian
Government maintains two lighthouses, at the western and
eastern extremities respectively, and those entrusted with
their safe-keeping have as lonely an existence as may be
conceived. The welcome face of a stranger never brightens
their lives, except when the relief-boat draws in as far as it
dares in the calmest weather, or when some luckless wretches
are snatched from a vessel which has fallen into the toils of
the sand and is doomed. The sea-birds and seals are their
sole companions on this lonely outpost.</p>

<p>The necessity of indicating this death-trap to the mariner
was realized at the end of the seventeenth century, but it
was not until 1802 that a forward step was taken to ease the
plight of those who were thrown upon its shores. Then the
province of Nova Scotia voted a sum of £400 or $2,000, per
annum, for the maintenance of a fully-equipped life-saving
station. This sum was too slender to fulfil the purposes
conceived, but in 1827 the Imperial Government, recognizing
the humane character of the enterprise, voted a similar
appropriation, which is paid regularly, or was up to a
few years ago, towards its support. When the Dominion of
Canada became an accomplished fact in 1867, by the confederation
of the provinces, the matter was taken up whole-heartedly,
and since that date enormous sums have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
expended upon the island for the protection of shipping and
the mitigation of the sufferings of those cast upon its inhospitable
shores. At the present time three life-saving
stations and six relief stations, equipped with the best
modern apparatuses, are maintained, connected by telephone
and equipped with a staff of about twenty men. When the
gales are raging and the island is encircled in a broad band
of maddened spray stretching to the horizon, these men are
out patrolling the shore, ready to man the lifeboat upon the
first signals of distress. The life of these lonely workers now
is lightened very appreciably, as the island is fitted with a
wireless station, wherewith the men are able to talk through
space with the mainland and with passing vessels.</p>

<p class="captionc">The warning flash, thrown from a height of 137 feet, can be seen from a distance of 17 miles.</p></div></div>

<p>The west end light has passed through many vicissitudes,
and the keepers have experienced innumerable thrills. At
this point the ocean is devouring the island rapidly. In
1873 the tower was raised in what was considered a safe
position. It was placed some distance from the water’s
edge on a favourable knoll, and thought to be immune from
the gnawing of the sea for many years to come. But Nature
disposed otherwise. The awful winter of 1881 played havoc
with the island. One mighty gale carried away a solid
chunk 70 feet wide by nearly 1,400 feet long. When the
summer came, and an inspection was made, fears were entertained
concerning the safety of the lighthouse. The keepers
had observed violent tremblings, for the tower vibrated
considerably under the smashing blows of the waves.
Nothing could be done that summer, and it was hoped that
the succeeding winter would be milder, to enable plans to be
prepared for the construction of a new tower in a safer
position. The keepers, however, were urged to keep a sharp
eye on developments, and to be prepared for any emergency.
The winter of 1882 proved to be worse than that of the
previous year, and the island suffered more than ever. The
keepers and their isolated comrades viewed the advance
of the waves with ill-disguised alarm. Would the island
around the light hold out until the spring? That was the
uppermost thought. Every gale brought the waves nearer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
and at last it was recognized that one good gale would finish
matters. So the men prepared for the emergency. The
demolition of the tower commenced, a race between the
waters and human labour. The men worked well and had
just got the superstructure away, when there was a creak, a
groan, and a crash! The foundations, which had been undermined,
disappeared into the Atlantic. In less than ten years
the hungry ocean had carried a mile of Sable Island away.</p>

<p>THE WEST END GUARDIAN OF SABLE ISLAND, THE
GRAVEYARD OF THE ATLANTIC.</p>

<p class="captionc">This tower replaces the structure demolished by the waves.</p></div></div>

<p>In 1888 the present magnificent lighthouse was brought
into service. It is a ferro-concrete tower of octagonal shape
rising from a massive plinth of the same form, and is provided
with four equidistantly-spaced wing buttresses to hold
the structure more rigid in rough weather. The building is
set on a knoll rising 20 feet above the water, and about 2,100
yards east of the extremity of the western dry spit of land,
so that the Atlantic will have to gnaw a considerable distance
before it will render the position of this light untenable.
The tower is 97 feet in height, bringing the white ray 118 feet
above the level of the sea. The light is of the group revolving
type, thrown once every three minutes. The warning
is made up of three flashes, with an eclipse of thirty seconds
between each flash, followed by darkness for ninety seconds,
and may be seen sixteen miles away. While the beacon
mounts guard over the main end of the island on one side,
there is a dangerous submerged bar which runs north-westwards
and westwards for seventeen miles. The light at the
east end, which was erected in 1873, is likewise carried on an
octagonal tower 81 feet high, but, being set upon a more
commanding position, the beam is elevated to 123 feet. It
is erected five miles south-westwards of the extreme tip of the
island, and gives a white flash at intervals of three seconds,
followed by an eclipse of fifteen seconds; it may be picked
up seventeen miles away. Similarly, this light mounts guard
over a submerged sand-bar, which extends eastwards for
at least fourteen miles.</p>

<p>During the late summer and autumn the majority of the
vessels plying between ports on the St. Lawrence and Europe
take the shorter route round the northern corner of Newfoundland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
through the Straits of Belle Ile. This is a highly
dangerous passage, inasmuch as the narrow streak of water,
seventy miles in length, with a maximum width of eleven
miles, separating the frowning coasts of Newfoundland and
Labrador, is strewn with menaces, the most formidable of
which is Belle Ile, which lies right in the centre of the entrance
from the ocean. The island is really a lofty hump of
rock, twenty-one miles in circumference, with the shores for
the most part dropping precipitously into the water. It is
an extremely lonely spot, and, naturally, is feared by the
mariner. His apprehensions, however, have been considerably
relieved, because the channel is brilliantly lighted by
several powerful lights visible from twelve to twenty-eight
miles, while another is being established.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE GULL ISLAND LIGHT, NEWFOUNDLAND.</p>

<p class="captionc">A very lonely beacon, visible for 27 miles.</p></div></div>

<p>The beacons are distributed along the shores of Newfoundland,
Belle Ile, and Labrador, one powerful light being
placed on Cape Bauld, the northernmost point of Newfoundland,
and another on Cape Norman, another promontory to
the west. These two lights are visible from twenty and
sixteen miles respectively, while on the opposite side of the
strait is Amour Point light, guarding the south-east side of
Forteau Bay on the Labrador shore, which has a range of
eighteen miles. Cape Bauld is the most important mainland
beacon, inasmuch as it indicates the entrance to the
Belle Ile Straits. Belle Ile is well protected at its two
extreme tips, the principal light being at the southern end.
The necessity of guiding ships between the island and Newfoundland
was recognized half a century ago, for this light
was erected in 1858. It is perched on the summit of the
cliff, 400 feet above the sea, the occulting light of ten seconds’
duration and five seconds’ eclipse being thrown from an
altitude of 470 feet, rendering it distinguishable twenty-eight
miles away. Unfortunately, however, the extreme
elevation of the light often causes it to be enshrouded in
impenetrable banks of clouds, which drape the headland; so
in 1880 an auxiliary light was established, 346 feet below the
upper light. This beam is similar in character to the one
above, and, from its elevation of 124 feet above the water, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
may be picked up from seventeen miles out. Consequently,
in foggy weather the lower light may be seen when the upper
beacon is obscured. This is one of the most important points
on the coast, being a marine telegraph, signal, and ice-report
station, while it is also fitted with wireless telegraphy. An
interesting feature in connection with this light is that it was
kept going for three generations by one family, the Coltons,
whose name is legendary in Quebec, and some of whom
were born and died on Belle Ile.</p>

<p>The second light, on the northern extremity of the island,
to indicate the northern entrance into the straits, is of
recent date, having been brought into operation in 1905.
It is a tower of iron, encased in a white octagonal reinforced
concrete covering capped with a red polygonal-shaped
lantern throwing a flash of half a second once every eleven
seconds from a height of 137 feet, visible from a distance of
seventeen miles.</p>

<p>Fogs and mists are two great perils peculiar to this
northern waterway, so the splendid lighting arrangements
are supported by excellent and powerful fog-signals. The
northern light has a diaphone giving a blare lasting three and
a half seconds every minute, while the southern station
has a siren giving a double tone. First there is a low note
of two and a half seconds followed by silence for two and a
half seconds; then a high note of two and a half seconds
and a silent interval of 112½ seconds. This signal is emitted
from a point midway between the upper and lower lights,
the air for the blast being compressed by water-power.
Another humane provision is the depot at the southern
station, which is kept stocked with food supplies for the
benefit of shipwrecked mariners. In 1898 a freighter
carrying a deck-load of 400 oxen went ashore beneath this
light and became a hopeless wreck. The crew, realizing the
impossibility of saving the animals, fired the ship, so that
the animals were suffocated and bruised, thereby sparing the
inhabitants of the island a deadly risk, and solving the difficult
problem which otherwise would have arisen, had the
brutes been drowned in the ordinary way and their decomposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
carcasses cast up on the beach. In the following
year the Dominion liner <i>Scotsman</i> crashed on to the rocks
near the same spot, and likewise became a total loss, with a
death-roll of nine. By dint of great effort the survivors
scrambled ashore, and had a weary trudge of nine miles
over a broken, rock-strewn wilderness to gain the lighthouse
station and assistance, arriving in a famished and exhausted
condition, to be tended by the light-keepers and their
families.</p>

<p>Belle Ile is a lonely station in the fullest sense of the
word, although the keepers are better off now than they
were a few years ago. The straits are busy in the summer,
being crowded with shipping, but with the coming of
November all life disappears, and the liners do not return
until the following May or June. The rock is cut off from
the mainland by the masses of ice which pile up in the
estuary, together with the crowds of icebergs which come
down from Greenland. For six months the guardians of
the light are isolated from the world at large, although they
have a slender link of communication in the submarine
cable. But the storms and stress of winter often rupture
this line, and, as the wireless installation is closed down
when navigation ceases, the keepers and their families
settle down to a silent, weary vigil, knowing nothing of the
rest of the world, and all but forgotten by civilization,
because an interruption in the cable cannot be repaired
until the ice disappears.</p>

<p>AN “ICE SHOVE” UPON THE BACK RANGE LIGHT IN LAKE ST. PETER.</p>

<p class="captionc">This photo gives a striking idea of the trouble experienced with ice in Canadian waters.</p></div></div>

<p>Even when the Gulf of the St. Lawrence is entered, the
navigator is not free from peril. The waterway is littered
with rocks and islands. Among these are Coffin Island
and Anticosti, the latter being the private property of
M. Henri Ménier, the French chocolate magnate. For many
years the St. Lawrence was a byword to navigation, and
wrecks were numerous. It was shunned by navigators and
abhorred by underwriters. Even to this day the latter
regard it askance, and the insurance rates are high upon
vessels trading in these waters. Through the efforts of the
Department of Marine and Fisheries, the Dominion Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
is removing this stigma from their great marine
avenue, and their engineer-in-chief. Lieutenant-Colonel
William P. Anderson, to whom I am indebted for much
information concerning the guardians of the Canadian coasts,
has displayed commendable enterprise and ingenuity in
combating the natural odds pitted against human endeavour
to render the coasts of the country more friendly to
navigation.</p>

<p>In the St. Lawrence the great foe is ice. Its onslaughts
are terrific, and none but the strongest works has a chance
to survive the enormous pressure exerted when the ice is
on the run after the break of winter. As is well known,
for some five months in the year the river is frozen so thick
and solid that it will support a train. Naturally, when this
armour collapses, and the floes are hurled seawards by the
current, they concentrate their destructive energies upon
any obstacles in their way, piling up in huge masses weighing
thousands of tons. It is no uncommon circumstance for
the floes to pack in a jagged heap 50 feet high, while
all the time there is a continual push against the obstruction.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances extreme ingenuity has to be
displayed in the erection of the fixed lights. The floating
lights, such as buoys, escape this peril, as they are picked
up when navigation ceases, to be housed in quarters on
dry land, and replaced when the river is open once more.
Yet it is not only the ice in itself which causes trouble.
The level of the river rises when the ice is running, and this
pressure alone is enormous, while the scouring action about
the foundations is terrific. The type of structure adopted
varies with the situation and character of the light. The
beacons for the aid of navigation, in common with the
practice upon American waterways, are divided into groups
or ranges, and the captain picks out his channel by keeping
these lights and marks in various lines. Maybe four or five
lights have to be brought into line, and accordingly the
height of the unit of each range varies from its fellow. Thus,
the front light will be low, that behind a little higher, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
so on, until the last light in the group, or “back light” of
the range, as it is called, is a lofty structure.</p>

<p>In some places the light is placed in mid-stream, and
perhaps mounted upon a massive, high, steel caisson,
resting upon a concrete foundation, thereby proving immovable
to the most powerful of ice-shoves. Or a large pier
carried out in ferro-concrete and pyramidal in shape is used.
In the case of the back light there is a skeleton tower, which
structure is employed to gain the necessary height. This
is carried upon a high, huge, solid plinth of concrete, even
if built against the bank. The frazil ice dams the channel,
causing the water to rise, and unless the foregoing precautions
were adopted widespread damage would result. All
the lights between the gulf and Montreal have to be protected
in this manner, so that it will be seen that the adequate
lighting of this waterway bristles with engineering
difficulties of no light character, and is expensive.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government also is responsible, to a certain
extent, for the lighting of the Great Lakes, which is described
in another chapter, where similar difficulties prevail.
It has also a long stretch of the most rugged part of the
Pacific coast to patrol, aggregating about 600 miles between
Victoria and Vancouver to the Portland Canal, where
Canadian meets Alaskan territory. This is a wicked coast,
broken and battered, as well as flanked by an outer barrier
of islands, recalling the Scandinavian Peninsula in its general
topographical characteristics. During the past few years
the necessity of lighting this seaboard adequately has become
more pronounced, owing to the creation of the new port of
Prince Rupert, a few miles below Alaskan territory, where
the Grand Trunk Pacific reaches down to the western sea,
and the growing sea-borne traffic with Alaska. The fact
that a large portion of this navigation is maintained through
the inside passages, bristling with sharp turns, narrow
defiles, and jagged headlands, which for the most part are
wrapped generally in fog, renders the lighting problem more
intricate. Probably the most important light, and certainly
the loftiest on the Pacific seacoast north of the Equator,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
is that on the summit of Triangle Island, British Columbia.
It was built in 1910, and although the lantern itself is only
46 feet in height, the elevation of the headland brings the
white group-flashing light of 1,000,000 candle-power 700 feet
above the sea, giving it a range of thirty-four miles. Four
flashes are emitted during each ten seconds, each flash
lasting 0·28 second with intervening eclipses each of 1·28
seconds, with an eclipse between each group of 5·94 seconds.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson has introduced a new type
of reinforced concrete lighthouse with flying buttresses.
The latter are not required for strength, but are utilized to
give greater stiffness to the tower, as a column 100 feet or
more in height, no matter how strongly it may be built,
must vibrate and swing in high winds. Yet it is desirable
to keep the lantern as steady as possible, and this is achieved
much more completely upon the above principle. The
engineer-in-chief of the lighthouse authority of the Canadian
Government considers this method of construction to be the
last word in lighthouse building, and has completed some
notable works upon these lines. Perhaps the most important
is the Estevan Point light, on the west coast of Vancouver,
at a place known as Hole-in-the-Wall. The tower,
of octagonal, tapering form, is 127 feet in height, and throws
a white group-flashing light, comprising three flashes each
of 9·3 seconds with two eclipses, each of 1·37 seconds, and a
final eclipse of 6·36 seconds between each group, seventeen
miles out to sea. The surroundings of this station are most
romantic. Landing anywhere in its vicinity is extremely
difficult and dangerous, and the engineer had to select a
point about two miles distant for this purpose. From this
place a road and tramway have been laid through a grand
primeval forest, such as is to be found only upon Vancouver
Island, wherein roams a drove of magnificent wild cattle.</p>

<p>While the Canadian coast cannot point to any lighthouse
work comparing with the Eddystone, Skerryvore, or Heaux
de Bréhat, yet its most powerful beacons are of a commanding
character, representing as they do the latest and best
in connection with coast lighting. There is an enormous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
stretch of difficult shore to patrol, along which has to
be guided an immense volume of valuable shipping. In
addition to the attended lights, the Government has been
extremely enterprising in the adoption of unattended
beacons (described in another chapter), miles of lonely,
inhospitable shore being guarded in this way. Although
the development in this direction is of comparatively recent
date, the protection of maritime trade is being carried out
in accordance with a comprehensive policy, so that within
a few years the coasts of the Dominion will be rendered as
safe to the shipping of the world as human ingenuity can
contrive.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MINOT’S LEDGE LIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Lovers of Longfellow will recall the poet’s song to the
lighthouse, but how many of his admirers know to what
beacon these stirring lines refer? When they were penned
the author had in his mind’s eye an example of the engineer’s
handiwork which ranks as one of the finest sea-rock lights
in existence, worthy of comparison with the most famous
of similar structures scattered throughout the waters washing
the Old World.</p>

<p>This is the far-famed Minot’s Ledge light, warning the
seafarer making to and from Boston Bay of the terrible
peril which lurks beneath the waves on the southern side
of the entrance to this busy indentation. “Like the great
giant Christopher it stands,” a powerful monument to
engineering genius, dogged perseverance against overwhelming
odds, and a grim, bitter contest lasting five weary years
between the implacable elements and human endeavour.
The Minot Ledge is one of those jagged reefs which thrust
themselves far out into the sea, studded with pinnacles and
chisel-like edges, which never, or very seldom, protrude
above the waves. Ship after ship fouled this danger spot,
either to be sunk or to be so badly crippled that it barely
could contrive to crawl to safety.</p>

<p>The prosperity of Boston was threatened by this peril to
shipping, and therefore it is not surprising that a resolution
was passed to devise some ways and means of indicating its
presence to those who go down to the sea in ships. The solution
was offered in a skeleton structure fashioned from iron,
which was designed by Captain W.&nbsp;H. Swift, of the United
States Topographical Engineers. He searched the reef
through and through to ascertain the point where the beacon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
should be placed so as to prove of the greatest value. This
in itself was no simple matter, inasmuch as Minot’s Ledge
is but one of a great area of wicked crags, which collectively
are known as the Cohasset Rocks, and which straggle
over the sea-bed in all directions. After the position had
been reconnoitred thoroughly, and sounding and levels had
been taken, the engineer decided that the most seaward
rock of the group, known as the Outer Minot, would be the
most strategical position, and accordingly he planned to
erect his beacon thereon.</p>

<p>It was a daring proposal, because the reef at the point
selected only exposes some 25 feet of its mass above the
falling tide, and then the highest point of the rock scarcely
thrusts itself 3½ feet into the air. It was realized that the
periods of working between the tides would inevitably be
very brief, while even then, owing to the open position
of the ridge, a landing would only be possible in very smooth
weather, and the men would have to suffer exposure to the
fury of the waves as they dashed over the ledge.</p>

<p>Captain Swift decided upon a skeleton iron structure, not
only because it would be quicker to erect and would cost
less, but because it would offer the least resistance to the
waves, which would be free to expend their energy among
the stilts. The task was taken in hand at the first favourable
opportunity, and, the system lending itself to rapid
construction, marked progress was made every time the
workmen succeeded in getting on the ledge. The lantern
and keepers’ quarters were supported upon nine piles, 60 feet
above the rock. The legs were so disposed that eight
described the circumference of a circle, while the ninth constituted
the axis.</p>

<p>This tower was completed in 1848, and for the first time
the navigator making these treacherous waters received a
powerful warning to keep clear of Minot’s Ledge. For
three years the beacon survived the battering of wind and
wave, but its welcome beam was last seen on the night of
April 16, 1851. In the spring of that year a gale of terrific
fury beat upon the Massachusetts coast. The wind freshened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
on April 13; the next day it rose to its full force, and
did not abate for four days. The good people of Boston
grew apprehensive concerning the plight of the two keepers
of the lonely Minot’s light, but, however willing they might
have been to have put out to the beacon, they were absolutely
impotent before the ferocity of the elements. Time after
time the light vanished from sight as it was enveloped in an
angry curling mountain of water. On April 17 the doleful
tolling of the lighthouse bell was heard, but the light was
never seen again. The structure had slipped completely
from sight, together with its faithful keepers, swallowed by
the hungry Atlantic. Evidently the wail of the bell was a
last plea for assistance, because no doubt the lighthouse
had bowed to the storm and was tottering when the tolling
rang out. But the call brought no help; it was the funeral
knell of the guardians of the beacon. When the sea went
down a boat pushed off to the ledge, and all that was seen
were a few bent piles. Captain Swift had done his work
well. The waves could not tear his beacon up by the roots,
so had snapped off the piles like carrots, and had carried
away the lantern.</p>

<p class="captionl">Marking the rock off Boston Harbour, it is one of the greatest works completed by the lighthouse
builders of the United States. It forms the theme of Longfellow’s well-known poem.</p></div></div>

<p>This sensational disaster, after a brief existence of three
years, did not augur well for the permanence of a light upon
this precarious ledge. The Outer Minot appeared to be
determined to continue its plunder of ships, cargoes, and
lives, untrammelled. Accordingly, for three years no effort
was made to bring about its subjugation.</p>

<p>In 1855 General Barnard, one of the most illustrious
engineers which the United States has ever produced,
brought forward the plans for a structure which he thought
would resist the most formidable attacks of wind and wave.
He took Rudyerd’s famous Eddystone tower as his pattern.
This was perhaps the strongest design that could be carried
out against the sea, having one weak point only&mdash;it was
built of wood. General Barnard contemplated a similar
structure for Minot’s Ledge, but in masonry.</p>

<p>The Lighthouse Board, which had recently been inaugurated
to control the lighthouses around the coasts of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
country, examined the idea minutely, and submitted the
design to the most expert criticism and discussion, but all
were so impressed with its outstanding features that they
decided to support it whole-heartedly. A minute survey of
the rock was prepared, and the plans were straight away
perfected for the preparation of the masonry on shore. So
carefully was this work carried out, that, with the exception
of a few blocks of masonry constituting the foundations,
which had to be prepared on the site, and some slight variations
in the method of construction, the original ideas were
fulfilled.</p>

<p>Work was commenced in 1855, the building operations
being placed in the hands of B.&nbsp;S. Alexander, at that time
Lieutenant of Engineers, and the successful completion of
the work was due in a very great measure to his ability and
ingenuity, because the whole undertaking was placed in
his hands and he had to overcome difficulties at every turn
as they arose.</p>

<p>The builder was handicapped in every way. First there
was the brief period in which operations could be carried
out upon the site, the working season extending only from
April 1 to September 15 in each year. This is not to say
that the masons were able to toil upon the rock continuously
every day during this interval&mdash;far from it. In order to
get the foundations laid there were three essentials&mdash;a perfectly
smooth sea, a dead calm, and low spring-tides. Needless
to say, it was on very rare occasions indeed that these
three requirements were in harmony. As a matter of fact,
they could occur only about six times during every lunar
month&mdash;three times during full moon, and three at the
change. Even then, either the wind or the sea intervened
to nullify the benefits arising from the lowest tides. So
much so that, although work commenced at daybreak on
Sunday, July 1, 1855, only 130 working hours were possible
upon the rock before labours ceased for the season in the
middle of the following September.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>TENDER LANDING BUILDING MATERIAL UPON THE TILLAMOOK ROCK.</p>

<p class="captionc">A derrick has been provided to facilitate these operations, while a stairway leads from the landing point to the lighthouse.</p></div></div>

<p>On gaining the rock, Lieutenant Alexander decided to
make use of the holes which had been driven into the granitic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
mass by Captain Swift to receive the piles of the previous
structure. The twisted and broken pieces of iron were
withdrawn and the holes cleaned out. Simultaneously the
upper surface of the rock was pared and trimmed by the aid
of chisels, which was no easy task, because at times the
masons were compelled to manipulate their tools as best
they could in two or three feet of water. This preparation
of the rock to receive the base constituted one of the most
notable features of the work. In the greater number of
other outstanding achievements upon sea-rocks the surface
of the latter has been above the waves at lowest spring-tides,
whereas in this case a great part of the foundation
work was continuously submerged.</p>

<p>This preparation of the rock-face necessitated the final
trimming and shaping upon the site of many of the masonry
blocks forming the root of the tower. They could not
possibly be prepared ashore to bring about the tight fit
which was imperative. Accordingly, all but the bottom
faces of the blocks were prepared in the depot on the mainland,
and they were then shipped to the ledge for final paring
and trimming.</p>

<p>The attachment of the bottom courses to the rock-face
was carried out very ingeniously. Bags of sand were brought
on to the rock and laid around the spot upon which a particular
block of stone was to be laid. The sacks, being
filled with sand, were pliable, so that, when deposited, they
adapted themselves to the contour of the ledge, and prevented
the water making its way in under the rampart.
The water within this small dam was then removed, sponges
being used in the final emptying task, so as to suck out the
salt sea from the cracks and crevices, leaving the surface on
which the block of stone was to be laid quite dry. A film
of cement was then trowelled upon the rock surface, and
upon this was laid a sheet of muslin. The inclusion of the
muslin was a wise precaution, because while the work was
in progress a wandering wave was liable to curl over the
rock, swamping the small dried space, when, but for the
presence of the muslin, the cement would have been carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
away. At the same time the cement was able to penetrate
the meshes of the muslin when the stone was deposited, so
as to grip the surface of the latter and to hold it tightly
in position.</p>

<p>Under such abnormal conditions of working the masons
had many exciting moments. No matter how smooth was
the sea, several renegade waves would plunge over the ledge.
The masons had to be prepared for these unwelcome visitors,
and precautions had to be introduced to prevent them being
washed off their slender foothold. A substantial iron
staging was erected over the working area on the rock, to
facilitate the handling of the building material. A number
of ropes were attached to this staging, the free ends of which
dangled beside the workmen. These were the life-lines, one
being provided for each man. A lookout was posted, who,
when he saw a wave approaching and bent upon sweeping
the rock, gave a shrill signal. Instantly each workman
dropped his tools, clutched his life-line tightly, threw himself
prostrate on the rock, and allowed the wave to pass over
him. The situation certainly was uncomfortable, and the
men often toiled in soddened clothes, but an involuntary
bath was preferable to the loss of a life or to broken limbs.</p>

<p>Work advanced so slowly that during the first two years,
which were devoted to the excavation of the pit and the
preparations of the rock-face, only 287 hours’ work were
accomplished. In the third year this task was completed,
and four stones laid in a further 130 hours 21 minutes. By
the end of the working season of 1859 twenty-six courses
were finished, so that, while the volume of work fulfilled in
1,102 hours 21 minutes, and spread over five years, certainly
was not imposing, it was remarkable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The stones for the foundations were sent from shore
with the indication -3’ 5”, -2’ 9”, -1’ 3”, and so on, indicating
that these stones were prepared for positions 3 feet
5 inches, 2 feet 9 inches, and so on, below zero. And the
zero mark was 21 inches below water! Above the zero
mark the stones were prefixed by a “plus” sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
The shaft is purely conical, and solid except for a central
well extending from the foundations up to the level of the
entrance. The successive courses of stones were secured
to one another, and each stone was attached to its neighbour
in the ring by the aid of heavy iron dogs, so that the lower
part of the shaft forms a practically solid homogenous mass.
What are known as continuous “dowels” were sunk
through each course of masonry into the holes in the solid
rock prepared by Captain Swift for his skeleton light, this
further attachment of the mass to the ledge being continued
until the twelfth course was gained. Thus additional
security is obtained by anchoring the tower firmly to the reef.</p>

<p>The solid portion of the building is 40 feet in height from
the level of the first complete ring of stones, and the tower
is 80 feet high to the lantern gallery. The over-all height
to the top of the lantern cupola is 102¾ feet, while the focal
plane is 84½ feet above mean high-water. The first stone
was laid on July 9, 1857, while the masons completed their
duties on June 29, 1860, so that five years were occupied
upon the work. In erection 3,514 tons of rough and 2,367
tons of hammered stone, in addition to 1,079 numbered
stones, were used, and the total cost, including the light-keepers’
houses on the mainland, was £60,000, or $300,000,
so that it ranks among the more costly lights which have
been provided for the seafarer’s benefit.</p>

<p>On November 15, 1860, nine and a half years after the
destruction of the first beacon, the light was once more
thrown from Minot’s Ledge for the benefit of passing ships.
The light is of the second order, visible fourteen and three-quarter
miles out to sea, and is of the flashing type, signalling
“143” every thirty seconds thus&mdash;one flash followed
by three seconds’ darkness, four flashes with three seconds’
eclipse, and three flashes with an interval of fifteen seconds’
darkness.</p>

<p>The tower has been subjected to repeated prodigious
assaults, the north-east gales in particular thundering upon
this reef with tremendous fury, but it has withstood all
attacks with complete success.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TILLAMOOK ROCK LIGHT-STATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While the Northern Pacific Ocean is the loneliest stretch
of salt water in the world, yet it possesses one or two busy
corners. Prominent among the latter is that where it
washes the shores of the United States around the entrance
to the mighty Columbia River. The estuary is wide, and,
although navigation is handicapped by a bar, it is well
protected. But coming up from the south there is a
stretch of terribly forbidding coastline, with the cliffs at
places towering 1,500 feet or more into the air and dropping
sheer into the water. Rock-slides are of frequent occurrence,
and the beach is littered with heavy falls from above.
Here and there protuberances rise from the sea, formed of
rock sufficiently dense and hard to withstand more effectively
the process of erosion, only to constitute fearful menaces
to navigation. Often the mainland is completely obscured,
either by streaks of mist or heavy clouds of smoke produced
by forest fires, which in the dry season rage with great
violence. A ship caught within the toils of this stern coast
has no possible chance of escape, while the crew would find
it difficult to get ashore, inasmuch as at places there is not
a single landing-place within a distance of twenty miles.</p>

<p>Owing to the coast being frequently blotted from view,
and to the fact that this stretch of sea is swept by furious
storms, the plight of the mariner making to or from the
Columbia River became exceedingly precarious. The worst
tragedy of these waters was enacted on the dark and stormy
night of January 3, 1881, when the sailing-ship <i>Lupata</i> lost
her way and went to pieces on the rocks off Tillamook
Head.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is not surprising that an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
outcry arose for protection along this lonely reach of Oregon’s
jagged shoreline. The authorities responded to the agitation
by the promise to erect a lighthouse, once they should
have decided the site, which was the really perplexing
question. In the first instance it was thought that its
location upon the mainland would suffice, but a survey
betrayed the futility of such a choice. The light would be
too elevated to be of any service; for the greater part of
its time it would be rendered invisible by land fogs. Then,
again, it would mean cutting a road for a distance of twenty
miles through heavy, undulating country and primeval
forest to gain the point, as the verdant sea of green timber
extends to the very brink of the cliffs.</p>

<p>After prolonged consideration, it was decided to erect
the light upon the Tillamook Rock. This is a hard mass of
basalt, rising boldly from the water to a height of 120 feet,
which, when viewed from one side, presented the appearance
of a clenched fist. It stands about a mile off the mainland,
twenty miles south of the Columbia River mouth, and drops
plumb into the sea, where the lead gives readings ranging
from 96 to 240 feet. The whole area of the rock is less than
one acre, and it is split almost in two; another isolated
knot of basalt, upon which the seas break heavily when a
storm is raging, rears its shaggy head into the air near by
at low-tide. The only possible landing-point is on the east
side, where there is a beach sloping upwards sharply from
the water to the crest. When the ocean is roused the sight
certainly is terrifying. The waves fall with shivering force
upon the base of the rock, to rush up its ragged sides and
sweep right over its crest in a dense curtain of angrily
frothing water and whipping spray.</p>

<p>Despite its fearsome character, this rock constituted the
most serviceable situation for a light, for the reason that,
being a mile from the shore, it was free from land fogs and
clouds. The decision of the authorities depended upon
three factors only&mdash;that a landing could be made, the rock
occupied, and the requisite building materials unloaded.
The introduction of such a saving clause was politic, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
at first it seemed as if the rock would defy the gaining
of a foothold. The ghastly failure attending the survey, as
described in a previous chapter, brought public opinion into
dead opposition to the project, and many fearsome stories
were circulated sedulously up and down the coast and
among the towns fringing the Columbia River concerning
the perils, hardships, and terrible death-roll, which would
attend any attempt to place a beacon on this rock.</p>

<p>After the disaster the authorities pressed forward the
enterprise with greater vigour than ever, so as to get work
well under way before public opinion would be able to
make its influence felt upon the unsophisticated minds of
workmen required to carry out the undertaking. A daring,
determined, and energetic leader was secured in Mr. A.
Ballantyne, and he was deputed to rally a force of eight or
more highly skilled quarrymen with whom to proceed to
Astoria, where the land headquarters were to be established.
He was informed that upon arrival at this point he would
find everything in readiness for his immediate departure to
the rock, with all essentials to enable him to commence
work at once and to provide quarters for the workmen,
who would be compelled to suffer isolation and a certain
amount of discomfort for weeks at a time. It was impossible
to take more than a handful of men at first, owing
to the difficulty of landing provisions.</p>

<p>Mr. Ballantyne started off with his small picked force,
reached Astoria on September 24, 1879, and there suffered
his first check. The autumn gales had sprung up, rendering
approach to the rock absolutely hopeless. There was no
alternative; he must wait until the weather moderated.
As this might be a question of a few hours, days, or perhaps
a week or two, the chief grew anxious concerning his force.
If the men, having nothing to do, wandered idly about the
town, making acquaintance with all and sundry and listening
to gossip, then they could not fail to be impressed with the
extraordinary stories concerning dangers, hardships, perils,
and adventures; would conclude that the Tillamook was a
“hoodoo” rock; and would desert him promptly. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
guard against this contingency, the quarrymen were hurried
off and temporarily housed in the old light-keeper’s dwelling
at the Cape Disappointment light, some miles away on the
northern portal of the estuary, where they were safe from
pernicious influences.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE TILLAMOOK ROCK LIGHT STATION FROM THE SOUTH.</p>

<p class="captionc">Rising from the sea one mile off the Oregon Coast, it was for years a terrible danger spot. The light of 160,000 candle-power, 132 feet above high
water, is visible for 18 miles.</p></div></div>

<p>After twenty-six days of enforced idleness the squad was
picked up by a revenue cutter, which steamed to the rock,
and made fast to a buoy that had been laid previously for
mooring the vessels deputed to transport building materials
and other requirements. With extreme difficulty four men
were got on the rock, together with a supply of hammers,
drills, iron ring-bolts, a stove, provisions, supplies, and an
abundance of canvas, with which the advance staff were
to erect temporary shelters and to make themselves as
comfortable as they could. While the work was in progress
the wind freshened, the swell rose, and the boat had to retire
hurriedly before the remainder of the force could be landed;
but five days later they were transferred to the rock, together
with further provisions and supplies, as well as a derrick.</p>

<p>The little party soon received a taste of what life would be
in this lonely spot. Three days after the second landing,
and before they had shaken down to their strange surroundings,
a gale sprang up. Heavy seas pounded the rock,
and the waves, mounting its vertical face, threw themselves
over its crest, drenching the workmen and their sleeping
blankets. It was a startling episode, but it became so
frequent that the quarrymen became inured to their fate,
and were not perturbed in any way, except when the Pacific
was roused to exceptional fury.</p>

<p>When the first four men gained the rock it was seen that
the landing of material, especially the heavier incidentals,
would constitute the greatest difficulty. Then an ingenious
idea was advanced. Why not rig a heavy rope between
the mast of the vessel and the top of the rock, draw it taut,
and devise a traveller to run to and fro? It was a practical
suggestion and was adopted forthwith. With much difficulty
a 4½-inch rope was towed from the vessel&mdash;to the mast
of which one end was secured&mdash;to the rock, and grabbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
by those in occupation. This end was anchored firmly, and
constituted the track. Then a large single block was rigged
to this main line in such a way that it could move freely
to and fro along the cable. This block was provided with
a heavy hook on which the weights could be slung. Other
blocks were fixed on the vessel and on the rock, while an
endless line, passing through these blocks at each end, and
attached to the shank of the hook on the travelling block,
enabled the traveller to be pulled freely and easily in either
direction.</p>

<p>Both men and supplies were transferred from ship to shore
by this primitive, albeit ingenious, system. The men were
carried in a novel device, described as a “breeches-buoy,” such
as is used with the rocket life-saving apparatus, but of very
crude design improvised on the spot. It was contrived
from an ordinary circular rubber life-preserver, to which a
pair of trousers cut short at the knees were lashed tightly.
This was suspended from the block-hook by means of three
short lengths of rope. The trip through the air certainly
was novel, and not free from excitement; indeed, there was
just sufficient spice of adventure about it to appeal to the
rough-and-ready, intrepid spirits who constituted the forces
of the lighthouse engineer. Also, owing to the primitive
character of the apparatus, there was just the chance that
something would go wrong when the man was between ship
and rock. The breeches were provided to hold the man
in a safe position while in the air, to guard against a loss of
balance and tipping out; while should anything give way,
and the man make an unexpected plunge into the water,
the life-preserver would keep him afloat until a boat could
draw alongside to rescue him.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE TERRIBLE TILLAMOOK ROCK.</p>

<p class="captionc">Showing how the menace rises abruptly from the sea on one side.</p></div></div>

<p>There was another factor which had to be taken into
consideration, and which certainly contributed to the
novelty of the trip. As the boat responded to the action
of the waves the rope alternately drew tight and sagged.
When she rolled towards the rock the cable was slackened,
and the man generally had a ducking; the next moment,
when the vessel rolled in the opposite direction, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
whisked unceremoniously and suddenly into the air. It was
like being suspended at the end of a piece of elastic. The
men for the most part enjoyed the fun of the journey, and
considered it a new and exhilarating “divarshun.” Among
themselves the effort was to travel in either direction so as
to escape a cold douche on the journey. When the water
was rough, speculation took the form of guessing how many
dips into the water would be made before either terminus
was gained.</p>

<p>This novel landing method provoked one amusing incident.
The supply-boat came out to the rock one day bringing a new
raw hand. The cableway was rigged up, and the workman
prepared for his ride to the rock. But the man was somewhat
corpulent, and could not be thrust through the preserver.
This was an unexpected <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">contretemps</i>, and it seemed
as if the superintendent would have to let his recruit return.
But Ballantyne did not worry over trifles, neither did he
relish the idea of losing a hand after having him brought so
far, so he put forward a somewhat daring proposal. He
told the captain of the steamer to lash the workman to the
top of the buoy, and they would pull him ashore all right.
The labourer was scared out of his wits at this suggestion,
and resented being handled as if he were a balk of timber.
Why, even the perishable articles were unloaded in casks
to protect them from the wet. He expressed his determination
to see them to perdition before he would make a trip
through the air under such conditions. Ballantyne was
somewhat crestfallen at the cold reception of his brilliant
idea, so told the captain to take the workman back to
Astoria, and to ransack the place to discover a buoy which
would be big enough to fit him.</p>

<p>Two days later the vessel returned with the larger buoy
and also the corpulent quarryman. His second glimpse of
the primitive travelling frightened him worse than ever,
and he point blank refused to budge. In order to reassure
the raw hand, Ballantyne hauled the buoy ashore, and,
jumping into it, made a journey, to illustrate that the
system was perfectly safe, and that one need not even get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
wet. But Ballantyne’s demonstration was rather unfortunate.
The cable was slack, and the ship rolled heavily.
Result: the superintendent was dragged through the water
for nearly the whole distance, and at times nothing of him
could be seen. When he landed on the boat, half-winded
and drenched to the skin, the quarryman was scared more
than ever, and announced his intention to return to Astoria.
Ballantyne cajoled, coaxed, argued, and stormed, in turn,
but to no avail. Then another idea came to his fertile mind.
If the man would not travel via the breeches-buoy, why not
send him ashore in a bos’n’s chair? This was rigged up
satisfactorily, and therein the workman consented to go
ashore, though not without the display of considerable
trepidation and anxiety to keep out of the water. They
got him on the rock safely, and without so much as wetting
the soles of his feet. The quarryman by his resolute opposition
set up a record. He was the first man to land dry on
the Tillamook.</p>

<p>Subsequently this novel and, so far as it went, efficient
method of “quick transit” was superseded when the men
on the rock got their big derrick to work. The long arm of
this appliance leaned over the water far enough to pick up
the goods direct from the deck of the vessel moored off the
rock. This system was quicker, and enabled the goods to
be got ashore unsoiled.</p>

<p>The first men to land found the rock in the occupation
of sea-lions, who swarmed its scaly sides in huge numbers,
even making their way to the crest to bask in the sunshine.
These tenants at first resented the white man’s invasion,
and were somewhat troublesome; but at last they recognized
that their eviction was certain, so suddenly deserted in a
body to another equally wild spot farther south.</p>

<p>The first task was the preparation of the site for the building.
The fist-like overhanging crest was attacked to prepare
a foundation, thereby reducing the height from 120 to 91 feet.
The rock surface was scarred and riven in a fantastic
manner, owing to the scouring action of the waves eroding
the soft portions leaving the hard rock behind in the form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of needles, scales, and ugly crevices. The outer part of the
rock, moreover, was found to be of an unreliable character,
being more or less rotten, while the core, on the other hand,
was intensely hard, and promised an excellent foundation
for the beacon. The superfluous mass was removed by
blasting, this being carried out with extreme care and in
small sections at a time. The largest blasts did not remove
more than 130 cubic yards, or tons, of débris at one time.
This slow blasting, by handfuls as it were, was necessary so
as not to shatter or impair the solidity of the heart of the
rock, which was to support the buildings.</p>

<p>Drilling and blasting were carried out in the face of great
difficulties. Rain, rough seas, spray, and heavy winds,
combined to thwart the little band of workers toiling strenuously
in solemn loneliness upon this bleak crag. Often days
would pass without any tangible impression being made
upon the surface. The drilling holes would be swamped,
and unless care was observed the powder charges ran the
risk of being damped and rendered impotent or uncertain
in firing. In the attack upon the crest the workmen
distributed themselves around the crown. On the precipitous
side, as there was not a friendly ledge on which to
secure a foothold to work the drills, bolts were driven into
the rock-face, from which staging was suspended by ropes,
and on this swinging, crazy foothold the men drove their
tools with salt fleece whirling round them.</p>

<p>Until the men were able to erect more or less permanent
quarters, their plight at times was pitiable. The canvas
was cut up and an <span class="sans bold">A</span>-tent was rigged up. It was a cramped
home, measuring 16 feet long by 6 feet wide, while the ridge
pole was only 4½ feet above the ground. This domicile just
held the ten men in their sleeping-blankets. Naturally, they
had to crawl rather than walk about, and, as the shelter
served as a dining-room as well, the little band had to tolerate
many discomforts. When the wind howled round the
rock, causing the canvas to flap violently and threatening
to carry it away at every turn, when the sea swarmed over
the rock, and when the heavy rains to which this coast is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
subject poured down pitilessly, the men never knew what
it was to have dry clothing or bedding. Cooking was carried
on in the open, and the kitchen arrangements had to be
shifted from time to time, according to the direction of the
wind, so that the fire was brought on the lee side of the
shelter.</p>

<p>The workers were exposed to danger on all sides incessantly,
but fortunately in their chief, Ballantyne, they had
one of those men who appear to be made for such contingencies;
who was alert, ready for any emergency, nursed
his staff sedulously, and whose buoyant spirits dispelled all
feelings of gloom, loneliness, or homesickness. The little
band toiled hard and long through the rough autumnal
weather, and the arrival of stern winter did not bring any
cessation in their labours. They fought the rock grimly
and ignored hardship. Certainly, they were cheered by the
arrival of the boats with supplies, but occasionally a fortnight
or more would pass without a call being made at the
rock, and often, when a boat did come up and prepare to
land material, it had to slip its anchor hastily to make a
frantic run for safety before the rising swell and the gathering
storm.</p>

<p>Early in January Nature concentrated her forces, as if
bent upon a supreme effort to shake the determination and
courage of the little army striving so valiantly upon the rock.
On the night of New Year’s Day the clouds assumed an
ominous appearance, and accordingly the workmen were
not surprised to meet a stormy and rainy reception when
they made their way to their duties the following morning.
The weather grew worse on the third day, the spray
enveloping the rock and drenching the men, while the wind
blew so fiercely that they could scarcely keep their feet.
During the next two days it increased in force, while the
sea grew angrier. On the 6th the elements were raging in
torment, and in the afternoon Ballantyne, taking stock of
the meteorological signs, came to the conclusion that the
party “were in for it.” A hurricane, or possibly a tornado,
was looming. The tools were being swung with infinite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
difficulty, when suddenly came the signal “Stop work!”
Ballantyne urged them to set to at once to lash everything
securely. At six o’clock in the evening the hurricane burst,
and the workmen witnessed a sight such as they had never
seen before. The whole coast was in the grip of a tornado,
of which the Tillamook Rock was the vortex, whereon the
elements concentrated their destructive forces. The huge
rollers assumed an uglier appearance than ever; the broken
water rushed up the steep sides into the air, where it was
caught by the whirling wind and dashed on the tiny camp.
It was impossible to escape that savage attack, as it was
driven home from all sides simultaneously. The men took
to their permanent quarters in silence and very gloomy.
By midnight the roof was being peppered with huge masses
of rock, which, detached by the waves, were caught up
and thrown clean over the rock. Ballantyne urged the
men to stay in their bunks, to keep up their spirits, and to
seek a little rest.</p>

<p class="captionl">The rear tower was built on Cape Henry in 1789, with stones shipped from Great Britain. Owing to the sand thrown up by the sea, another light
had to be provided nearer the water, and was completed in 1879. The old light is retained as an historic building.</p></div></div>

<p>But sleep was impossible. The quarrymen were scared
out of their wits, and there was every cause for their dismay.
It seemed as if the very rock itself must succumb to the
savage onslaught. The din was deafening; the rock shivered
and trembled as the breakers hurled themselves upon it.</p>

<p>It had just turned two. Suddenly one and all sat up in
terror. There was a fearful crash&mdash;a rending and splitting,
which was heard plainly above the weird howling of the
hurricane. The men tumbled out of their bunks panic-stricken,
and were about to stampede from their shelter to
seek refuge upon a higher ledge. But Ballantyne’s pluck
asserted itself. He, too, had been scared by the awful noise,
but he collected his scattered wits more quickly than did his
comrades. He grasped the situation, and with iron nerve
commanded all the men to stick tightly where they were.
An ugly rush seemed imminent, but he stood with his back
to the door, and in plain English dared the men to leave
their cover. Any man who attempted to fight his way to
the upper refuge would be swept overboard by the wind
and sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
The quarrymen were not cowards, and Ballantyne’s
action steadied them. Then the foreman announced his
intention to go out to see what had happened. He grabbed
a storm-lantern and opened the door. Instantly he was
hurled back by the wind and sea, which appeared to be
submerging the rock. For two hours he stood waiting an
opportunity to slip out against the hurricane. At last he
succeeded, and in the intense darkness endeavoured to grope
his way over the rock. He had been gone only a few
minutes when he staggered back, battered, shaken, and
almost exhausted. He could not make headway against the
gale. So the men sat down and silently waited the approach
of dawn. Then they found that the rushing waves had fallen
upon the building in which all their supplies were stored,
had smashed it to atoms, and had destroyed and carried
away nearly all the provisions, the fresh-water tank, and
other articles, although the requisites for work were left
untouched. It was the break-up of this storehouse which
had woke them from their slumbers and had provoked the
panic.</p>

<p>For ten days the gale raged, being more furious on some
days than others. When it decreased in fury the men were
able to settle to their work for an hour or two, but progress
was painfully slow; on other days not a tool could be picked
up. On the 18th the revenue cutter came out from Astoria
to ascertain how the men had weathered the tornado, and
the signal for coal and provisions was answered immediately
by the lowering of a surf-boat. The sailors had a stiff pull
to reach the rock, found that the men still had a scanty
supply of hard bread, coffee, and bacon&mdash;this was all&mdash;and,
taking off the letters, promised to send supplies immediately.
The construction ship also came up; the captain
sent ashore all the provisions he could spare, and undertook
to return at once with a full supply. But another ten days
passed before the sea went down enough to permit these to
be landed, together with five more men.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE RACE ROCK LIGHT.</p>

<p class="captionc">It marks a dangerous reef in Long Island Sound, where, owing to the swift currents, construction of the foundations proved very difficult.</p></div></div>

<p>Nature appeared to capitulate after this terrible assault,
and work proceeded rapidly. The crest of the rock was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
removed and levelled off, to form an excellent platform for
the reception of the beacon and other buildings. An inclined
tramway was excavated out of the rock-face, communicating
with the landing-stage, to facilitate the haulage
of the light-keepers’ necessities, and then the arrangements
for the completion of the building were hurried forward.</p>

<p>When the public saw that the work was being accomplished
without loss to life or limb, and that the plucky little
party of toilers weathered the gales, an intense interest was
manifested in the undertaking. The foreman was provided
with an international code of signals, and passing
vessels, as an act of courtesy and in recognition of the
work that was being done to further their safety, always
stood towards the rock to render assistance in case it was
required. The workmen appreciated this feeling, and on
two occasions, during dense fog, intimated to captains who
had lost their way, and were groping blindly round the
rock, that they were venturing into dangerous waters. The
warning was primitive but effective. It comprised the
explosion of giant-powder cartridges over the sea in the
direction whence the ships’ sirens sounded. In both instances
the navigators heard the signals in the nick of time,
and were able to steer clear.</p>

<p>The lighthouse itself comprises a group of buildings for
the keepers, from which rises a square tower 48 feet in height,
bringing the light 132 feet above mean high-water. The
dwelling is built of stone, measures 48 feet by 45 feet, and is
one story in height. In addition there is an extension for
housing the powerful siren and its machinery. The building
contains adequate living-quarters, together with storage
rooms and a kitchen. As this light is particularly lonely,
four keepers are stationed on the rock, and their rooms each
have a clear length of 12 feet by 10 feet wide. Also, as the
rock is so difficult to approach, and relief may suffer extreme
delay from adverse weather, sufficient provisions are stored
to insure full rations for six months.</p>

<p>The light is of the first order, of 160,000 candle-power,
and is visible at a distance of eighteen miles in clear weather.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
It is a brilliant white flashing beam, occurring once every
five seconds, the flash being of two seconds, followed by an
eclipse of three seconds. The fog-siren is likewise of the
first order, driven by steam-engines. This plant is in
duplicate, and the signal is given every forty-five seconds,
the blast being of five seconds, followed by silence for forty
seconds.</p>

<p>The conquest of the Tillamook Rock has been one of the
most difficult tasks that the United States Lighthouse Board
ever has accomplished. The little band of quarrymen who
braved danger, hardship, and privation, effected occupation
of the rock on October 21, 1879, and the light was exhibited
for the first time on January 21, 1881, the total time occupied
in the task being 575 days. It has robbed the dreaded
Oregon coast of one of its worst perils, and the money which
was devoted to the provision of this stalwart guardian&mdash;£24,698,
or $123,493&mdash;was indeed expended to good purpose.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE COAST LIGHTS OF THE UNITED STATES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Few nations have such a varied coastline to guard as the
United States. On the Atlantic seaboard the northern
shore is a shaggy bold rampart of lofty cliff, hard and pitiless.
Farther south the rock gradually gives way to sandy
dunes, which the hungry sea is continually gnawing away
here and piling up somewhere else. Then, as the tropics
are entered, the sand in turn gives way to coral reefs, every
whit as formidable as rock and as treacherous as sand,
where the hurricane reigns supreme and makes its presence
felt only too frequently. Across the continent a similar
variation, though not perhaps so intense, is observable on
the Pacific side. The coast range runs parallel with the
shore, and consequently cliff and precipice are common,
owing to the lateral spurs of the range coming to an abrupt
termination where land and water meet.</p>

<p>The result is that no one type of beacon is possible of
adoption as a standard for the whole coastline. The class
of structure has to be modified to meet local conditions,
but the battle between destruction and preservation is none
the less bitter and continuous. When ships began to trade
with the Atlantic seaboard of the United States, the erection
of warning lights became imperative. This duty was fulfilled
in the early days by local enterprise, and the first
lighthouse on the continent was built on Little Brewster
Island, at the entrance to Boston Harbour. It was completed
about 1716, was a conical masonry tower, and its cost,
which is interesting as being set out to the uttermost farthing&mdash;£2,285
17s. 8½d.&mdash;betrays the scrupulous commercial
integrity of the first financiers of the United States. The
light was maintained by the levy of a due of one penny per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
ton on all incoming and outgoing vessels, except those
engaged in coastal traffic, and was collected by the same
authority which subsequently got into trouble in the endeavour
to collect the tax on tea. This pioneer light is still
in service, although in 1783 it was rebuilt. The light, of the
second order, is 102 feet above mean high-water, and gives
a white flash every thirty seconds, which is visible from a
distance of sixteen miles; the fog-signal is a first-class siren,
giving a blast of five seconds, followed by silence for ten
seconds, with a succeeding blast of five seconds and silence
for forty seconds.</p>

<p>The excellent example thus set by the good people of
Boston was followed by other States and individual authorities
along the coast. This system of local and arbitrary
control was by no means satisfactory, so in 1789 the Federal
Government took over the control of the lighthouse service,
and entrusted its safe-keeping to the Secretary of the
Treasury. There were only eight lights to watch when the
cession was effected, but the growth of the country soon
increased the duties of the department. Accordingly, a
decree was passed in 1817 whereby the control was transferred
from the Secretary of the Treasury to the fifth auditor
of the same department, Mr. Stephen Pleasanton, who
became known as the General Superintendent of Lights.
He assumed the new office in 1820, taking over fifty-five
lights, so that during the thirty years the aids to navigation
had been under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the
Treasury forty-seven new stations had been established.</p>

<p>The new official held the post for thirty-two years, and
prosecuted his work so diligently and systematically that
by 1852 the service had grown to 325 lighthouses, lightships,
buoys, and other guides. The lighthouses were maintained
under contract, the contractor for each light undertaking
for a fixed annual sum to keep his charge in a perfect state
of repair, to supply all illuminant, wicks, chimneys, and
stores, that were required, as well as making one visit to
the lighthouse in the course of the year. Subsequently it became
necessary to award the contracts for terms of five years.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE CARQUINEZ STRAIT LIGHT.</p>

<p class="captionc">An imposing station on the north side of the entrance to the Strait.</p></div></div>

<p>As time progressed, and the duties of the Superintendent
became more onerous, certain individuals took exception to
the idea of such an important service being entrusted to the
charge of one man, vested with wide discretionary powers.
Accordingly, complaints were formulated liberally, and the
superintendent became the butt of venomous attack. The
outcome of this agitation was the formation of a committee,
two members of which were sent upon a mission of inspection
to Great Britain and France, the lighthouse services of
which were stated to be far superior to that of the United
States, and more efficiently controlled. The result of this
investigation was the inauguration of an official department
known as the Lighthouse Board, constituted of capable
engineers. In 1852 this authority took over the administration
of the light service, which has remained under its
control ever since. In order to secure the utmost efficiency,
the coasts were divided into districts, each of which is presided
over by an accomplished officer of the United States
Corps of Engineers, who is held directly responsible to the
Board at Washington for the lights in his area. So admirably
was the new authority constituted that it has never
failed to give the utmost satisfaction, and the result is
that to-day the Lighthouse Board of the United States is
comparable with contemporary authorities in the Old
World.</p>

<p>In the early days the majority of the lights were placed
on the mainland, and as a rule comprised wooden towers,
projecting from the roof of the keepers’ dwelling, similar
in character to some of the older lights to be found on the
coasts of Newfoundland and New Brunswick in Canada.
These buildings were cheap to construct, as they were
carried out upon the timber-frame principle; but they possessed
many disadvantages. The greatest objection arose
from the attachment of the tower to the roof frames of
the house. Being exposed to the full fury of the tempest,
the tower in time would become loosened, and the roof
itself distorted, so that the inmates had to suffer the inconvenience
of water penetrating into their rooms. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
few masonry towers which were erected were of the most
primitive description, and soon fell victims to the ravages
of the weather.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the lighthouse administration was
placed upon an efficient footing, the first task was the complete
overhaul, and reconstruction where necessary, of
many of the existing lights. Of the eight beacons which
were taken over by the Federal Government in 1789, six
have been rebuilt. The only two exceptions are the Sandy
Hook light&mdash;a stone tower 88 feet high&mdash;and Cape
Henlopen, at the entrance to Delaware Bay, both of which
were built in 1764. Naturally, their illuminating apparatus
has been remodelled from time to time, in accordance with
the advances in this field of lighthouse engineering, but
that is the only change which has been effected.</p>

<p class="captionl">A fixed white light, thrown from the tower of St. Philip’s Church, and visible for 18 miles, forms

<p>One lighthouse on the Atlantic coast of the United States
possesses a pathetic and romantic interest. It indicates
the treacherous shores around Cape Henry, and mounts
sentinel on the headland at the southerly side of the entrance
to Chesapeake Bay, Virginia. The stranger on the passing
ship, as he scans the dreary bench of sand rising from the
water’s edge at this point, has his attention arrested by
two gaunt towers. The foremost is almost lapped by the
water; the other is some distance to the rear, and upon a
higher level. “Two lights, and for what?” is a natural
exclamation. But only one tower&mdash;that nearer the waves&mdash;throws
its glare by night. Its companion behind has
passed its cycle of utility long since, but it has not been demolished
because of its unique history. It was built in
1789 with bricks and stones brought from England. In
shape it is a tapering octagonal cone, and when first erected
the waves almost washed its base. But the sea, which
eats away the rock and soft soil at some parts, casts this
débris ashore here, so that Cape Henry is slowly but surely
thrusting its dismal tongue of sand farther and farther into
the Atlantic. The old tower fulfilled faithful service until
the seventies, when, being considered too far from the
water, it was superseded by the shaft rising from the sand-dunes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
below. After a century’s service the old light was
extinguished, to permit the fixed white light of the first
order in the new tower to take its place.</p>

<p>The new building, completed in 1881, is likewise octagonal
in section, gradually tapering from the base to the lantern
gallery. It is built upon what is described as the “double-shell
principle,” there being two iron cylinders, one within
the other. It is 152 feet in height, and the powerful white
beam has a range of twenty miles, while a red beam is cast
from one side to mark a dangerous shoal. As a powerful
flashing white light of a similar character is shed from a
tower on Cape Charles opposite, the mariner has a well-illumined
entrance into Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>Ice was one of the great difficulties against which the
American lighthouse builders had to contend, and they
laboured valiantly to mitigate this evil. It caused more
damage to their works than wind and wave of the most
terrifying violence. The upper reaches of the great rivers
are encased with thick ice throughout the winter. When
the spring comes round, this brittle armour is broken up,
and, caught by the current, is swept toward the ocean, the
floes jostling and crashing among one another. When the
slightest obstruction is offered to their free movement, the
pieces mount one another, forming large hummocks, and
the pressure thus imposed is terrific. The “ice-shove,”
when it assumes large proportions, is quite capable of
wreaking widespread damage.</p>

<p>When the screw-pile lighthouses came into vogue, this
danger was advanced as one of the greatest objections to
the adoption of this idea. It was pointed out that the ice
would pack around the slender legs, and either snap them,
or would bring about such severe distortion as to imperil
the safety of the superstructure. When Major Hartman
Bache undertook the erection of the Brandywine Shoal
light in Delaware Bay, he determined to frustrate the
effects of this peril. The light, being eight miles from the
ocean, was right in the path of the ice-shoves of the Potomac,
so the nine iron legs upon which the beacon is supported&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>eight
in a circle and one central&mdash;are protected by what is
known as an “ice-breaker.” This is a pier of thirty iron
piles, which likewise are screwed into the sea-bed. Each
pile is 23 feet long by 5 inches in diameter, and they are
connected at their heads, and at a point just above low-water,
by what are known as “spider-web braces.” The
result is that, when a shock is inflicted upon one pile, it is
communicated throughout the entire breaker. This system
has proved entirely successful, and has protected the lighthouse
within completely. The main building, although
subjected to heavy attacks by the piled ice, has never been
damaged thereby, although subsequently it became necessary
to strengthen the ice-breaker, because the onslaughts
of several winters had left their mark.</p>

<p>Off the coast of Florida, and in the waters of the Gulf of
Mexico, this type of lighthouse is very strongly in evidence,
as it was found to be the most suitable for the coral sea-bed.
The most notable structure of this class is the Fowey
Rocks light, which rises, a flame-crowned skeleton, from the
extreme northern point of the Florida reefs. It is in an exposed
position, where inclement weather is often experienced.
At this point there is not more than 3 feet of
water, and the spot is as bad as a mariner could wish to
avoid, for no ship could hope to escape destruction once it
became entangled in these submerged toils.</p>

<p>The building of this light presented many perplexing difficulties,
the greatest of which was offered by the weather.
The structure is an octagonal pyramid, with the keepers’
quarters on a lower deck, communication with the lantern
being afforded by a winding staircase encircling a vertical
cylinder. The light is 110¼ feet above high-water, of the
fixed type, with red sectors guarding dangerous shoals in
the vicinity, while the white beams can be picked up some
eleven miles away.</p>

<p>The integral parts of this building were prepared by three
different contractors, were fitted together, and the building
set up temporarily, on the mainland, so as to facilitate
erection at the site. The work was started in 1876, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
first move being the provision of a platform about 80 feet
square and 12 feet above low-water, from which to conduct
operations. The lower piles were driven about 10 feet
into the live coral reef. Extreme care was observed during
this operation, the pile after every stroke of the driver
being tested with a plumb-line, to make sure that it was
being sent home absolutely vertically. If it diverged, however
slightly, from the perpendicular, the error was corrected
immediately. When the piles had been driven to the
requisite depth, the tops were levelled to the height of the
most deeply driven pile; then the horizontal members were
placed in position, followed by the diagonal bracing.</p>

<p class="captionc">While the tower is only 21 feet in height, its position on a lofty cliff gives the light of 27,000 candle-power a range of 17 miles.</p></div></div>

<p>This task occupied some two months, and then a spell of
bad weather broke over the coast, interspersed with brief
intervals of smooth seas and calms. As the land depot was
four miles away, this involved frequent journeys to and fro
for the workmen, who had to be brought off the work upon
the slightest sign of rough weather. To eliminate the
interruptions arising from this procedure, tents were despatched
to the site and pitched on the wooden platform,
so that the men might reside there. At times their situation
was alarming; the heavy seas rushed and tumbled
among the piles beneath the crazy perch, and the men were
always on tenterhooks lest a hurricane, such as is experienced
often in this region, should bear down upon them and carry
the whole colony away. When work was in progress, they
did not realize their lonely, perilous position so much, since
their minds were otherwise occupied; but it was the enforced
periods of idleness, often lasting several days on end,
which made them grow despondent, as they were virtually
imprisoned, and there was very little space in which to
obtain exercise. The material was brought out in lighters
towed by a steam-launch, on which steam was kept up day
and night, because the material had to be sent out at any
moment when the conditions were favourable. Again, this
“standing by” was imperative, in case a sudden call for
assistance should be given by the little isolated community
when faced with disaster during a storm. When the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
got the keepers’ quarters completed, their minds became
easier, as they were now in possession of a more stable
camp. The superstructure advanced at a rapid rate, and
the light was shown for the first time on June 15, 1878.</p>

<p>Toil of a different character was associated with the
building of the Race Rock lighthouse, eight miles from
New London, Connecticut. This peril is a submerged ledge
off Fisher’s Island Sound, and is of formidable magnitude,
since the ledge is at the mouth of the race, where the
waters, according to the tide, sweep along with great
velocity and force, while in heavy weather the waves get
up high and thunder with awful power. The main ledge
bristles with ugly sharp spurs, some of which rise above
the main cluster, known as Race Rock, which is about
3 feet below mean low-water. The situation of this lurking
danger called for the erection of an efficient beacon, though
not demanding a light of the calibre of Minot’s Ledge,
because even in rough weather the water does not mount
in the form of thick curtains of spray. A smaller and
different type of light, therefore, was considered to be
adequate for the purpose.</p>

<p class="captionc">This mariners’ friend has been tended by a woman for the past 30 years.</p></div></div>

<p>Even then, however, erection was not an easy matter by
any means. The velocity of the water and the submerged
character of the reef demanded the aid of divers to prepare
the ledge-face and to complete the foundations. The rock
was levelled as much as possible by the aid of small broken
stone and riprap. On this a heavy circular stepped plinth
of solid mass-concrete was laid. This foundation is 9 feet
in thickness, and is disposed in four concentric layers, the
lowermost of which is 60 feet in diameter by 3 feet in thickness.
The concrete was laid in huge hoops of iron, of the
desired height and diameter for the respective layers, to
prevent the mass from spreading. When this task was completed,
there was a level platform, as solid as the rock
itself, and projecting 8 inches above mean low-water. On
this a conical stone pier was built to a height of 30 feet, by
57 feet in diameter at the base. The top was crowned with
a projecting coping 55 feet in diameter. The outer face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
of this pier is composed of massive blocks of stone backed
with concrete; while in its heart are the spaces for cisterns
and cellars. From one side of this pier stretches a short
jetty, to form a landing-place.</p>

<p>The lighthouse comprises a granite dwelling of two floors
for the accommodation of the keepers, from the centre of
the front of which rises a granite tower, square at the base,
but round at the top, to carry the lantern, the light of which,
of the fourth order, is 67 feet above mean high-water.
The warning is an alternate flash of red and white, with a
ten seconds’ dark interval. For the protection of the base
of the pier, the ledge on all sides is covered with a thick layer
of boulders. The work was commenced in 1872, but,
owing to its difficult character, occupied six years. The
Race Rock lost its terrors for all time when the beam flashed
out on the night of New Year’s Day, 1879.</p>

<p>On the Pacific seaboard, while the American lighthouse
engineers have not been so active in regard to engineering
work of an impressive nature, owing to the more slender
proportions of the maritime traffic, they have accomplished
some notable triumphs. The Tillamook Rock light, described
in the previous chapter, is the most important, and
is to the Pacific seaboard of the country what the Minot’s
Ledge light is to the Atlantic coast. The majority of the
lights on the Pacific are stationed on the mainland, or contiguous
thereto. These beacons are of more modern construction
than those on the Atlantic shore, and in some instances
are very powerful. Pride of place in this respect
is shared between Point Arena and Cape Mendocino. The
former, perched on the cliff-shore of California, has a flashing
group of two flashes of <span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> second in five seconds, with eclipses
of 1<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> and 4<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> seconds respectively, thrown by its light of
1,000,000 candle-power over the water for a radius of
eighteen miles from a height of 155 feet. Cape Mendocino
light, on the same coastline, has the further distinction of
being the most elevated light on the United States Pacific
coast, the 340,000 candle-power beam being thrown for
ten seconds once every thirty seconds from an elevation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
422 feet. Although the tower itself is only 20 feet in height,
the cliff sheers up for 402 feet. Consequently the flash may
be detected from twenty-eight miles out to sea in clear
weather.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Point Cabrillo light, a few miles
south, whose flashing ray is of 650,000 candle-power, is picked
up from a distance of only fourteen miles, because the light
is but 84 feet above mean high-water. The Farallon
beacon, comprising a tower 29 feet high planted on the
highest point of Farallon Island, off San Francisco, comes a
good second in point of elevation, as the 110,000 candle-power
flash, occurring for ten seconds once in every minute,
is projected from an altitude of 358 feet, and can be discerned
twenty-six miles away. For many years the Point
Reyes light held the distinction of being the loftiest beacon,
since its flash of 160,000 candle-power once every five
seconds is shed from an elevation of 294 feet, but is now
relegated to third place in this respect. Taken on the whole,
the lights scattered along the rugged, lonely Pacific seaboard
are far more powerful than their contemporaries
guarding busier shipping on the eastern coast of the country;
but whereas the latter are placed somewhat close together,
the former are spaced far apart.</p>

<p>There are some points which, while being so extremely
perilous to the mariner as to demand the provision of a
lighthouse, yet cannot be guarded at present. The peculiarity
of their situations and their physical characteristics
completely defy the ingenuity, skill, and resource, of the
engineer. Cape Hatteras, perhaps, is the most forcible
illustration of this defeat of science by Nature. The sea-bed
for miles off this point is littered with the most treacherous
sandbanks, beside which the Goodwins of Britain
appear insignificant. Every seafarer knows the Diamond
Shoals, and gives them a wider berth than any other danger
spot in the seven seas. For some seven and a half miles out
to sea from the prominent headland, the Atlantic, according
to its mood, bubbles, boils, or rolls calmly, over shoals
and serried rows of submerged banks. The currents are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
wild and frantic; the storms which rage off this point are
difficult to equal in any other part of the world; and the
number of ships which have gone to pieces or have been
abandoned to their fate in these inhospitable stretches of
sea is incalculable.</p>

<p>Time after time the engineers have sought to subjugate
this danger, but without avail. The sea-bed is so soft and
absorbing that a firm foundation for a tower defies discovery.
One brilliant attempt was made to sink a caisson,
similar to that employed for the famous Rothersand light
in the River Weser. The mammoth structure was built,
and with extreme difficulty was towed out to the selected
site. But the seas roared against this attempt to deprive
them of their prey. They bore down upon the caisson
and smashed it to fragments, causing the engineers to
retire from the scene thoroughly discomfited. When a
huge mass, weighing several hundred tons, could be broken
up by the maddened seas so easily, of what avail were the
knowledge and effort of man? The Diamond Shoals still
resist conquest. The only means of warning ships of their
presence is a lightship moored well out beyond the pale of
their sucking embrace.</p>

<p>At the present time the United States Lighthouse Board
mounts guard over 17,695 miles of coastline. This aggregate
embraces, not only the two seaboards of the North American
continent, but sections of the Great Lakes, the Philippines,
Alaska, Hawaiian Islands, and the American Samoan
Islands, the total detailed coast or channel line being no
less than 48,881 miles. In order to guide the mariner
on his way through waters over which the Stars and Stripes
wave, no less than 12,150 lights of all descriptions are required,
demanding the services of an army of 5,582 men and
women; while the cost of maintenance exceeds £1,200,000,
or $6,000,000, per annum. Seeing that the country levies
no tolls for services rendered in this connection, the shipping
community, and humanity in general, owe a deep debt of
gratitude to a powerful nation.</p>

<p>The United States share with Great Britain, Austria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden,
the expense of maintaining a lighthouse which is situate
on the property of none of them. This is a kind of
no man’s, and yet it is every man’s, light. The beacon is
not located in an out-of-the-way part of the world, such as
the Arctic Sea, as might be supposed, but mounts guard
over one of the busiest marine thoroughfares of the globe&mdash;the
western entrance to the Mediterranean. This unique
light is that of Cape Spartel, on the Moroccan coast. While
it was built at the expense of Morocco, the responsibility
for its maintenance was assumed by the foregoing Powers,
in accordance with the convention of March 12, 1867, which
has remained in force since. There is no other light upon
the seven seas which has so many Powers concerned in its
welfare and maintenance.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LAMP-POSTS OF THE GREAT LAKES OF NORTH
AMERICA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On the North American continent the efficient lighting of
the coasts washed by two salt oceans is only one, although
the most important, concern of the United States and
Canadian Governments. In addition each has a long
stretch of rugged, tortuous shore hemming in those capacious
depressions draining a vast tract of country, and known
generally as the Great Lakes. These unsalted seas are
rightly named, seeing that they constitute the largest sheets
of fresh water on the inhabited globe.</p>

<p>The responsibility of safeguarding the navigator as he
makes his way across these wastes is shared equally by
the two countries which they divide, with one exception.
This is Lake Michigan, which lies entirely within the United
States. The narrow necks of water which link these lakes
into one long chain likewise are lighted by the two nations.
For some years the Lower Detroit River, connecting Lakes
Erie and St. Clair, was maintained for the most part by
the United States, but the practice was not satisfactory;
so, as the result of a conference between the two Governments,
Canada assumed charge of the aids in certain
specified portions of the navigable channel lying entirely
in Canadian waters. The result of this new arrangement
has been the better patrolling of the waterway.</p>

<p>The water-borne commerce on these lakes, although possible
for only half the year, is tremendous, while navigation
is extremely difficult and beset with innumerable
dangers.<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> The different means whereby a ship is handled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
and maintained on its course upon the salt-water ocean are
not completely applicable in this case. The greater number
of the boats are freighters and engaged in the transport
of ore, which, from its metallic character, is apt to disturb
the compass, rendering it somewhat unreliable. Nor is
the lead of much avail in thick weather, as the lake-bed
varies suddenly from comparative shallowness to great
depths. Navigation on these lakes has been likened to
coastal traffic, only with land on both sides of the mariner,
and the intervals when the ship is out of sight of the shoreline
are comparatively brief. Accordingly, the captain
picks his way rather by the aid of landmarks, and the
vessels are fitted with a bowsprit, to give the master a
point whereby to judge his direction. But landmarks,
however conspicuous and trustworthy they may be by day
and in clear weather, are useless at night and in fog, to which
latter visitation, by the way, these waters are extremely
susceptible.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> For a full description of the marine traffic on the Great Lakes,
see “The Steamship Conquest of the World,” chapter ix., p. 119.</p></div>

<p>Steamship traffic cannot be carried on with financial
success by daylight and in fair weather only, so it became
necessary to distribute beacons around the indented shores.
This procedure was rendered additionally necessary owing
to the formidable character of many of the dangers besetting
navigation, in the form of shoals, projecting ridges,
and submerged reefs, quite as terrifying to the master of
a fresh-water ship as similar dangers on an ocean-swept
coast.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, one would not expect to find
examples of lighthouse engineering comparable with the
great sea-rock lights rearing above the ocean, such as the
Minot’s Ledge, Dhu-Heartach, or Bishop’s Rock. On the
other hand, the uninitiated might conclude that buoys and
small lights, such as indicate the entrance to harbours,
would fulfil requirements. So they would but for two or
three adverse factors. These lakes are ravaged at times by
storms of great violence, which burst with startling suddenness.
Fogs also are of frequent occurrence, especially in
the spring and autumn, often descending and lifting instantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
like a thick blanket of cloud. But the most implacable
enemy is the ice. The engineer can design a tower
which will withstand the most savage onslaughts of wind
and wave with comparative ease, at, relatively speaking,
little expense; but the ice introduces another factor which
scarcely can be calculated. The whole of these lakes are
frozen over during the winter to such a thickness as to defy
all efforts to cut a channel, becoming, in fact, as solid as
terra firma.</p>

<p class="captionc">This tower marks the Racine Reef in 20 feet of water near the entrance to Racine Harbour on
the west coast of Lake Michigan.</p></div></div>

<p>In the spring this armour cracks and breaks up like glass
shattered with a hammer. It then becomes the sport of
the currents, which in many places sweep and swirl with
enormous force round the headlands and spits projecting
into the lake. This action sets the ice moving in stately
majesty, but crushing everything that rears in its way, or
piling and breaking against the obstruction. Ice-shoves,
ice-jams, and ice-runs, are the three forces against which
the engineer has to contend, and at places his efforts are so
puny as to be useless. The ice, if it collects across one of
the outlets so as to form a massive dam reaching to the lake-bed,
immediately causes the level of the lake to rise; and
when at last the barrage breaks, then the water is released
in a mad rush.</p>

<p>Lighthouse building on the Great Lakes demands the
highest skill, incalculable ingenuity, and the soundest of
design and workmanship. Consequently, some of the
guardian lights distributed around these shores, such as
Spectacle Reef, the Rock of Ages, Colchester, and Red Rock
lighthouses, are striking evidences of the engineer’s handiwork.
Of course, where the land presses in on either hand,
transforming the waterway into a kind of canal, or where the
shore is free from submerged obstructions, the type of lighthouse
on either shore follows the wooden frame dwelling
with a low tower, as it is completely adequate for the
purpose.</p>

<p>The one erection, however, which commands the greatest
attention is the Spectacle Reef light, which has been called
the Eddystone, or Minot’s Ledge, of the Lakes. In its way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
it was quite as bold an undertaking as either of these far-famed
works, and in some respects was far more difficult
to carry out, although the builder was spared the capriciousness
and extreme restlessness of tidal waters. Spectacle
Reef lighthouse rears its tapering head from a particularly
dangerous reef in an awkward corner of Lake Huron, where
commences the Strait of Mackinac, leading to Lake Michigan.
The spot is dangerous, because it is covered by
about 7 feet of water; awkward, because it occurs about
ten and a half miles off the nearest land, which is Bois
Blanc Island. The reef in reality comprises two shoals,
which lie in such relation to one another as to suggest a
pair of spectacles&mdash;hence the name. As it is exposed to
170 miles of open sea on one side, when these waters are
roused the rollers hammer on the reef with terrible violence,
while at times the currents skirl by at a velocity of two or
three miles per hour, and the ice in its movement grinds,
piles, and grates itself upon the reef in impotent fury.
When this ice is forced forward with the push exerted by
the currents, the pressure is tremendous and the force wellnigh
irresistible.</p>

<p>When the lighthouse was projected, it was realized that
it would have to be of massive proportions and provided
with adequate measures to protect it from the assault and
battering of the ice. The task was undertaken by General
O.&nbsp;M. Poe, who was engineer-in-chief to General Sherman
on his historic march to the sea. This engineer decided to
take the Minot’s Ledge monolithic structure as his model,
seeing that the latter had withstood the savage onslaughts
of the Atlantic. Fortunately, the foundations were of an
excellent character, the reef being formed of hard limestone.</p>

<p>BUILDING THE BARRE À BOULARD LIGHT IN THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE.</p>

<p class="captionc">Owing to the severity of the ice piling in this waterway, the structures have to be provided with massive foundations.</p></div></div>

<p>The engineer selected as the site for the tower a point
where the ridge is submerged by 11 feet of water. Seeing
that the base was to be laid under water, obviously it
seemed to be an operation for divers; but General Poe prepared
a superior means of getting the subaqueous foundations
laid. He built a cofferdam around the site, and, as the
work would have to be protected from the winter ice, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
built another cofferdam, entirely for protective purposes,
outside the former. The nearest point on the mainland
where he could establish a depot was Scammon’s Harbour,
some sixteen miles away, and here everything in connection
with the work was prepared and shipped to the site ready
for placing in position.</p>

<p>The protective work comprised a wooden pier, built up
of timbers 12 inches square, 24 feet in height. This structure
was divided into a series of vertical compartments
on all four sides, leaving a clear internal space 48 feet
square. The outer compartments or pockets were filled
with stone, to secure solidity and stability. Landing
facilities were provided on this pier, together with quarters
for the men engaged in the construction work.</p>

<p>In the inner space, containing 48 square feet of still water,
the cofferdam, in which the subaqueous work was to be carried
out, was lowered. This structure was cylindrical in form. It
was built up of staves, banded with heavy hoops of iron,
so that in reality it resembled a huge barrel 36 feet across.
It was fashioned at the site, being built while suspended
directly over the spot on which it was to be lowered. When
the tub was finished, loosely twisted oakum, 1½ inches
thick, was nailed all round the lower edge, while a flap of
heavy canvas was secured to the outside bottom rim in
such a way as to leave 36 inches dangling free. The exact
circular shape of the cofferdam was insured by liberal cross-bracing
from a central vertical post, which constituted the
axis of the barrel, corresponding to the vertical axis of the
tower. While this work was in progress, the face of the
rock was cleared of loose boulders, and then the cofferdam
was lowered bodily with extreme care, so that it descended
with unerring accuracy perpendicularly into the water, to
come to rest over the desired spot. As the surface of the
reef was very uneven, the cofferdam stopped when it
reached the highest projection under its edge. Then each
stave of the barrel was driven downwards until it came to
rest upon the sea-bed, and, as the oakum rope was forced
down likewise, this served to act as caulking. The outer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
flap of canvas, when the cofferdam was driven right home,
spread out on all sides, and lay upon the surface of the reef.</p>

<p>Pumps capable of discharging 5,000 gallons per minute then
were set to work, removing the water from within the cofferdam.
The oakum rope seal prevented the water regaining
the internal space under the bottom edge of the tub, while
the canvas assisted in securing absolute water-tightness,
because the outer water-pressure forced it into all the nooks
and crevices.</p>

<p>By these means the workmen were given an absolutely
dry space in which to carry out their erecting work. The
face of the reef was cleaned and levelled off, and the first
layer of stones was laid. These were first fitted temporarily
upon a false platform on shore, so that when they reached
the site they could be set at once without finicking. The
bottom layer is 32 feet in diameter, and the tower is solid
to a height of 34 feet above the rock. The stones are each
2 feet in thickness, and are secured to one another on all
sides with wrought-iron bolts, 24 inches long by 2½ inches in
diameter; while the tower is anchored to the rock by cement
and bolts 3 feet long, driven through the bottom course
into the real rock beneath, entering the latter to a depth
of 21 inches. Liquid cement was driven into the holes
so as to fill up all the remaining interstices, and this now
has become as hard as the stone itself.</p>

<p>The exterior of the tower is the frustum of a cone, and
at 80 feet above the base is 18 feet in diameter. The total
height of the masonry is 93 feet, and the focal plane is
brought 97¼ feet above the rock, or 86¼ feet above the water-level.
The tower is provided with five rooms, each 14 feet
in diameter, while the entrance is 23 feet above the water.
The undertaking was commenced in May, 1870, and the
light was shown first in June, 1874. As work had been
confined to the summer months, and a fortnight every
spring was devoted to preparations, as well as an equal
period in the autumn to making all fast to withstand the
rigours of winter, the total working period was only some
twenty months.</p>

<p class="captionc">An isolated station maintained by the Canadian Government. It is a fixed light, visible
throughout a circle of 16 miles radius.</p></div></div>

<p>The protection against the ice has proved its value completely.
The ice as it moves becomes crushed against the
defence, and then has its advance impeded by the shoal
upon which it grinds and packs, to form in itself a barrier
and ice-breaker against other approaching ice-fields. This
structure was soon submitted to a stern test to prove its
efficacy. In the spring of 1875, when the keepers returned
to the lighthouse&mdash;the light, in common with all other
beacons guarding the Great Lakes, is shut down during
the winter, when navigation is closed&mdash;they found the tower
unapproachable. The ice-shove had jammed, packed, and
been frozen into a solid berg to a height of 30 feet, of which
the tower itself formed the core. The doorway was buried
to a depth of 7 feet, and the keepers had to carve their way
with pickaxes to the entrance.</p>

<p>Owing to the success of the design for the Spectacle Reef
lighthouse, which ranks as a striking engineering achievement,
it was adopted for the Stannard’s Rock tower. This
ledge rises from the water 28 feet from shore, and the
plant and tackle which were employed in connection with
the first-named structure were utilized in this undertaking.
The tower is 191 feet in height, and the light can be seen for
about twenty miles. During the past two or three years
the United States Government has erected two other noble
lighthouses in Lakes Superior and Michigan. The first
warns all and sundry off a rock having three ugly pinnacles
projecting above the water, and known as the “Rock of
Ages.” This danger stands right in the steamship tracks
between Port Arthur and Duluth, off the western end of
Isle Royale. The engineers selected one of the pinnacles
as the base for the tower, decapitating the projection to
12 inches above mean low-water, so as to secure a sufficiently
large and level plinth. On this bed a cylindrical foundation
pier, of massive proportions and strength so as to withstand
the ice action, was planted, to support a lofty tower
in reinforced concrete. The building has seven floors, one
being set aside for housing the two twenty-four horse-power
oil-engines which are used to drive the air-compressors for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
the fog-siren. The light is 125 feet above water-level, and
gives a double flash at ten-second intervals, which can be
picked up twenty-one miles away. This tower was erected
in a very short time, the work, commenced in May, 1907,
being completed, except for the installation of the permanent
lens, thirteen months later. The optical apparatus
was fixed and the light shown first on September 15, 1910.</p>

<p>The second light has been placed on White Shoal, at the
north end of Lake Michigan, and supersedes a lightship
which fulfilled all requirements for many years. The shoal
is exceptionally dangerous, and the crowded character of
the shipping demanded the installation of a more powerful
light and fog-signal. The structure is a striking piece of
work, comprising a steel cylindrical tower, or shell, lined
on the inside with brick and faced externally with terra-cotta&mdash;an
unusual material for lighthouse construction.
The superstructure is built upon a massive concrete pier,
about 70 feet square, rising 20 feet above water-level,
this being borne in turn upon a heavy stone-filled timber
crib laid on a block-stone foundation, the whole being protected
thoroughly with riprap. The lantern is of the
second flashing order, with the focal plane 125 feet above
the lake-level, and the 65,000 candle-power ray is visible
twenty-five miles away. The tower is fitted with a duplicate
plant of twenty-four horse-power oil-engines and air-compressors,
operating an eight-inch whistle; and there is
also an electrically-operated submarine bell, the power for
which is generated by an independent oil-engine, the bell
being operated from the engine-room. This station is
equipped also with a compressed air water-supply system
and a motor-boat.</p>

<p>Owing to the peculiar prevailing conditions, the provision
of adequate beacons upon the Great Lakes is highly
expensive. Up to the year 1883 more money had been
devoted to the lighting of the shoreline of Lake Michigan
than to the illumination of any ocean or gulf in any other
State in the country. The total expenditure up to the
above year exceeded £470,000, or $2,350,000. The Spectacle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Reef light was considered cheap at £75,000, or $375,000;
and the Stannard Rock lighthouse, owing to the plant and
other facilities being available from the foregoing work, cost
£60,000, or $300,000. By the time the “Rock of Ages”
tower threw its light, £27,649, or $138,245, had been sunk;
and the White Shoals lighthouse absorbed £50,000, or
$250,000.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government, too, has completed some
notable works upon the Great Lakes during recent years.
In Lake Erie, in the fairway of passing traffic, is a ledge
known as Colchester Reef, on the south-east edge of which
a lighthouse, one of the most isolated in Canadian waters,
has been placed. The circular stone pier is built in 14 feet
of water, and the lighthouse, comprising a two-story dwelling
and tower, supports the beacon 60 feet above the lake.
The light is a fixed white, of the third dioptric order, visible
throughout a circle of fourteen miles radius.</p>

<p>At the entrance to Parry Sound, on a convenient site
offered by the solid granite mass of Red Rock, a new lighthouse
was constructed in 1911. This was the third beacon
placed at this point, the two previous lights dating from
1870 and 1881 respectively. It is a particularly bad spot,
since the waters of Georgian Bay have a free run, so that
the rock experiences the full hammering of the sea. The
beacon comprises a reinforced concrete building, nearly
elliptical in section, supported upon a heavy stone foundation,
which is encased in steel, and which is 12 feet high.
The tower has a height of 57 feet, bringing the occulting
flash of twelve seconds, with an eclipse of four seconds,
60 feet above the water. This station is also equipped with
a powerful diaphone. The keepers of this light experience
exciting times, as in a furious gale, such as the lakes only
can produce, the waves frequently crash over the building.</p>

<p>Another fine light in the stretch of these waters under
Canadian jurisdiction is found about halfway across Lake
Superior, where Caribou Island thrusts its scrub-clothed hump
above the water, almost directly in the path of the vessels
running between Sault Ste. Marie and Sarnia. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
magnificent structure, placed on a small islet lying off the
main island, is built in ferro-concrete, in accordance with
Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson’s latest ideas, and was opened
for service in 1912. It is of hexagonal shape, with six
flying buttresses, and the focal plane is brought 99 feet above
the water-level, so that the white flash of half a second may
be seen all round from a distance of fifteen miles.</p>

<p>The steamship lanes across the Great Lakes are now well
lighted. Canada alone maintains over 460 lights of all
descriptions throughout its waters between the eastern extremity
of Lake Ontario and the head of Lake Superior at
Port Arthur. The United States authorities watch over
694 attended and unattended aids to navigation in the same
seas, of which total 152 are scattered around the coastline
of Lake Michigan. The mariner in these fresh-water
oceans, consequently, has a round thousand lights to guide
him on his way, and the number is being steadily increased
to keep pace with the growth of the traffic, so that these seas
may become regarded as the safest and best protected in
the world.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MOST POWERFUL ELECTRIC LIGHTHOUSES OF
THE WORLD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a previous chapter I have mentioned that, although oil
is the most popular form of illuminant in lighthouse engineering,
electricity is maintained to be preferable, but labours
under one heavy disadvantage which militates against its
more general adoption. It is expensive to install and to
maintain. Under these circumstances the system has been
restricted to lights of the most important character, preferably
landfalls or beacons indicating the entrance to a
harbour. Thus, we have the Lizard at the entrance to the
English Channel; St. Catherine’s on the Isle of Wight; the
Rothersand at the entrance to the Weser; the Heligoland
flaring over the island of that name; the Isle of May at the
entrance to the Firth of Forth; Cape Héve near Havre;
and the Navesink light on the highlands of the New Jersey
coast, to guide the mariner into New York harbour.</p>

<p>The first attempt to apply electricity to lighthouse
illumination was made in the year 1859, by the Trinity
Brethren, on the strong recommendations of Professor
Faraday, who was then scientific adviser to the British
lighthouse authorities. The South Foreland light was
selected for the experiments, and the magneto-electric
machine invented by Professor Holmes, who subsequently
perfected the siren, was used.</p>

<p>The installation was built with extreme care, as the
imperative necessity of reliability, owing to the peculiar
nature of the application, was recognized very fully. The
large wheels made eighty-five revolutions per minute, and at
this speed produced a very steady light. On a clear night,
owing to the elevation of the cliff the light was visible for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
over twenty-seven miles, and could be descried readily
from the upper galleries of the lighthouses on the opposite
French shore. In order to determine the relative value
of electric lighting in comparison with the other methods
of illumination then in vogue, another light emitted by an
oil-lamp, with reflectors characteristic of the period, was
burned simultaneously from a point below the top light, so
that passing mariners were able to compare the two systems
of illumination under identical conditions.</p>

<p>The French lighthouse authorities were not dilatory in
adopting the new idea, and electricity was installed in
the Cape Héve lighthouse in 1863. The light was brilliant
for those times, being approximately of 60,000 candle-power.
The French investigators then embarked upon an
elaborate series of experiments, and in 1881 an electric
light of about 1,270,000 candle-power was established at
the Planier lighthouse, near Marseilles. The investigations
culminated in the great achievement of M. Bourdelles,
who, while engineer-in-chief of the Service des Phares,
designed a new electric installation for the Cape Héve
light, of 25,000,000 candle-power.</p>

<p>Meantime British engineers had not been idle. In 1871
Messrs. Stevenson, the engineers-in-chief to the Commissioners
of Northern Lighthouses, advocated strongly the
establishment of an electric light upon the Scottish coast;
but it was not until 1883 that the Board of Trade sanctioned
the sum necessary to complete such an enterprise, and suggested
that the innovation should be made at the Isle of
May lighthouse, as being the most important on the East
Scottish coast.</p>

<p>This is one of the historic light-stations of Scotland.
Lying in the Firth of Forth, five miles off the Fifeshire
shore, the islet obstructs a busy marine thoroughfare.
For 276 years a light has gleamed from its summit, the
change from the coal fire to Argand lamps with reflectors
having been made by Thomas Smith, the first engineer to
the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses, when this
body assumed its control in 1816. Twenty years later it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
was converted to the dioptric system, with a first-order fixed
light apparatus having a four-wick burner. This arrangement
was in service for half a century, when it was
converted to electricity in conjunction with a dioptric
condensing apparatus.</p>

<p>The electric installation was designed throughout by
Messrs. Stevenson, and it possesses many ingenious and
novel features to this day, while it was the pioneer of
modern electric lighting systems as applied to lighthouse
engineering. Although marked improvements have been
effected in electrical engineering and science since its completion,
it still ranks as one of, if not the, most powerful
electric lighthouses in the world. The beacon is a prominent
edifice on the summit of the island. The building is
somewhat pretentious, rather resembling a battlemented
castle than a warning for the mariner, the optical apparatus
being housed in a square turret rising above the main part of
the building. When electric illumination was adopted, the
existing accommodation for three keepers was found insufficient,
while a generating-station was necessary. Instead
of extending the old building to accommodate the additional
facilities, a second station was built at a low-lying point
near the sea-level. This contains the engine and generating
house, together with quarters for three more keepers and
their families. This decision was made because at this
point, 810 feet away and 175 feet below the lighthouse,
there is a small fresh-water loch whence water is available
for the boilers and condensers, while a marked saving in
the cost of handling fuel as well as of the haulage of the
building materials and machinery was feasible. The current
is led from the power-house to the lighthouse by means
of overhead copper conductors.</p>

<p>Some difficulty was experienced in securing electrical
apparatus suited to the searching exigencies of lighthouse
engineering, and the designers made one stipulation, which
at first appeared to baffle fulfilment. This was the placing
of the positive carbon below, instead of above, so as to
enable the strongest light to be thrown upwards, to be dealt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
with by the upper part of the dioptric apparatus, whereby
it could be used more effectively. One firm struggled with
this problem for many months, and then was compelled to
admit defeat, as time for further experimenting was unavailable,
since the lighthouse was almost completed.
Accordingly, the designing engineers had to revise their
plans, and had to acquire alternate-current De Meriten
machines, which, although more expensive and less powerful
than those originally intended, yet were, and are still,
wonderfully steady in working, while they had previously
proved highly efficient for lighthouse service. Two generators
of this description were secured, and they constituted
the largest that had been made up to this period,
each plant weighing about 4½ tons. Each machine
has sixty permanent magnets, disposed in five sets of
twelve each, while each magnet is made up of eight steel
plates. The armature makes 600 revolutions per minute,
and develops an average current of 220 ampères.</p>

<p>The installation is so designed that one-, two-, three-, or
four-fifths, or the whole, of the current can be sent from
each unit to the distributor for transmission to the lantern,
or the two machines may be coupled and the full current
from both utilized. The current is conveyed to the lantern
through copper rods 1 inch in diameter, and this was the
first occasion on which such conductors were utilized for
lighthouse work. There are three lamps of a modified
Serrin-Berjot type, one being in service, and the other two
held in reserve. By means of a by-pass, or shunt, a large
percentage of the current is sent direct to the lower carbon,
only a sufficient amount to regulate the carbons being sent
through the lamp. The carbons used are about 1½ inches
in diameter, though two-inch carbons can be employed when
both machines are running, and the rate of consumption
is 1¼ inches, or, including waste, 2 inches, per hour. The
power of the arc thus obtained with the current fed from
one generator is between 12,000 and 16,000 candles. In the
event of the electric installation breaking down, a three-wick
paraffin oil lamp is kept in reserve, ready for instant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
service, and it can be brought into use within three
minutes.</p>

<p>THE ELECTRIC SEARCHLIGHTS OF THE HELIGOLAND LIGHTHOUSE.</p>

<p class="captionc">On the lower level are three projectors spaced 120 degrees apart. Above is a fourth searchlight
revolving three times as rapidly as those below.</p></div></div>

<p>The dioptric apparatus, designed by Messrs. Stevenson,
and manufactured by Messrs. Chance Brothers and Co. of
Birmingham, is of a novel character, inasmuch as the condensing
principle has been carried to a pronounced degree.
The light characteristic is four brilliant flashes in quick succession
every thirty seconds. The lenticular apparatus also
includes the ingenious idea advocated by Mr. Thomas Stevenson,
an earlier engineer-in-chief to the Northern Commissioners
and perhaps the greatest authority on lighthouse
optical engineering, whereby the light may be dipped
during a fog. Thus, in clear weather the strongest part of
the ray may be directed to the horizon, while in thick
weather it can be brought to bear upon a point, say, four or
five miles away. The flashes are produced by a revolving
cage of straight vertical prisms, which enclose the fixed-light
apparatus. This cage makes one complete revolution every
minute, the rotary movement being secured through a train
of wheels and a weight, which has a fall of 60 feet in a tube
extending vertically through the centre of the tower, the
mechanism being wound up once an hour by manual effort.</p>

<p>The beam of light obtained by the aid of electricity is
of intense brilliancy and penetration. Its equivalent in
candle-power is somewhat difficult to determine, because
the methods of calculation are somewhat arbitrary and misleading.
By their own method of calculation, the engineers
responsible for the installation rate it at 3,000,000 candle-power
with one generator in use, and 6,000,000 candle-power
when both are going. This is from 300 to 600 times
as intense as the oil light which was superseded. By another
method of calculation the beam is of 26,000,000 candle-power,
while another principle of rating brings it to upwards
of 50,000,000 candle-power. In clear weather the light has
a range of twenty-two miles, being indistinguishable at a
greater distance, owing to the curvature of the earth; but
the flashes of light illuminating the clouds overhead may be
picked up forty or fifty miles away. The total cost of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
electrifying the Isle of May light was £15,835, or $79,175;
while the annual cost of maintenance is over £1,000, or
$5,000.</p>

<p>The most famous English electric lighthouse is that of
St. Catherine’s, in the Isle of Wight. This point, like the
Isle of May, has been a beacon for centuries. Its creation
for this work even antedates its northern contemporary,
because in the fourteenth century a chantry was built
by a benevolent knight on the highest point of St. Catherine’s
Downs, who furthermore provided an endowment
for a priest “who should chant Masses and maintain a
burning light at night for the safety of mariners.” But
this protection fell into desuetude.</p>

<p>The station, however, was revived upon the old site in
1785, but it had to be abandoned, because it was found
to be built at too high an elevation. It was so often enveloped
in fog as to be useless, or at least unreliable, to
the seafarer. A new tower, accordingly, was erected at a
lower level, and brought into service in 1840, the warning
rays being thrown from a height of 134 feet above the water.
Oil was used with a burner of six rings, the light being
officially known as a “fixed oil light of the first class,”
while the beam was diffused over an arc of 240 degrees.
In the middle eighties the Brethren of Trinity House decided
to bring it up to date, and selected electricity as the illuminant,
at the same time changing the light from the fixed
to the revolving class, with a five-second flash once every
thirty seconds.</p>

<p>THE HELIGOLAND LIGHTHOUSE.</p>

<p class="captionc">One of the most powerful electric beacons in the world. Its maximum candle-power is 43,000,000.</p></div></div>

<p>The installation is not widely dissimilar from that used
at the Isle of May. It comprises two De Meriten dynamos
in duplicate, while the lamps are of the modified Serrin-Berjot
type, using carbons, not of circular section, but with
fluted sides. This shape was introduced by Sir James
Douglass, who contended that the former type did not
produce the requisite candle-like steadiness of the flame so
essential to lighthouse illumination. The dioptric apparatus
was of the sixteen panel type, so that the rays were thrown
out in sixteen brilliantly white horizontal spokes. To one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
approaching the lighthouse at night-time, the effect in the
sky was somewhat curious. It recalled a huge and illuminated
cart wheel or Catherine wheel, lying flat on its side,
throwing its rays to all points of the compass in a steadily
moving circle. This practice had been borrowed from the
French, who went so far as to introduce a twenty-four panel
system, and, as in France, the St. Catherine’s light, when
first brought into service, was not a complete success. The
French considered that, by distributing the light through
as many panels as possible, the question of bringing the
flashes into action at short intervals would be facilitated,
ignoring the fact that by so doing the intensity of each ray
was impoverished. In other words, with the twenty-four
panel light each panel only received and threw out one-twenty-fourth
part of the volume of light emitted by the
arc. Similarly, in the St. Catherine’s light only one-sixteenth
part of the light produced was thrown through
each panel. A few years ago the optical system was replaced
by an apparatus having fewer panels. The light
thrown from the Isle of Wight pharos, with its beam exceeding
5,000,000 candle-power, represents a marked advance
upon the oil light which it displaced, and certainly it ranks
as the most brilliant light in the English Channel.</p>

<p>A few years ago another magnificent light was brought
into service in the North Sea by the installation of electricity
in the lighthouse of Heligoland. With characteristic
Teuton thoroughness, the Germans discussed the question
of the illuminant for this beacon in all its bearings, and
resolved to introduce the most powerful light possible.
This decision was influenced by the dangerous character
of the waters washing the island, as it is flanked on all
sides by highly perilous ridges and sandbanks, which
must become accentuated owing to the heavy sea-erosion
that prevails.</p>

<p>The German authorities investigated the various electrical
installations that had been laid down for lighthouse work,
with a view to discovering the most suitable system, the
advantages and defects of existing electric lights, and how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the drawbacks might be overcome most successfully. Meantime
the famous Siemens firm discovered a means of
grinding glass mirrors into parabolic form, and this discovery
was accepted as the solution to the problem.</p>

<p>In this type of mirror the back is silvered. The metallic
polished surface is protected completely from mechanical
injury and from all possibility of tarnishing. The inventors
claim that mirrors so prepared are able to compete successfully
with lenses and totally reflecting prisms&mdash;in fact, it
was maintained that the silvered glass parabolic mirror
possessed the advantages of greater reflecting power and
enhanced accuracy, with less divergence of the beam of
light.</p>

<p>Owing to the perfection of the lenses and prisms system
of lighthouse optics, the introduction of arc lights in conjunction
with parabolic mirrors was received with considerable
hesitation. In order to dispel these doubts, the above-mentioned
firm forthwith embarked upon an elaborate series
of comparative tests at Nuremberg to ascertain the relative
value of the two systems, and as a result of these experiments
they concluded that quite as good an effect is obtainable
with the arc and parabolic mirror as with the best
examples of any other method.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the authorities decided to install the system
in the Heligoland lighthouse. They stipulated that the
intensity of the beam of light should be at least 30,000,000
candle-power, with a maximum current of 100 ampères.
The duration of the flash was to be one-tenth of a second,
followed by eclipses of five seconds’ duration.</p>

<p>The electrical engineering firm entrusted with the contract
fulfilled these conditions by mounting three searchlights
spaced 120 degrees apart upon a rotating platform.
That is to say, each light is projected outwards from a point
equal to a third of the circumference of a circle. The mirror
diameter was settled at 75 centimetres (29½ inches) and
the focal length at 250 millimetres (10 inches), the current
being taken at 34 ampères when the table made four revolutions
per minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Subsequently a fourth searchlight was introduced into
the apparatus, for the purpose of practical experiments and
observations concerning the duration of the light-flash.
This fourth unit was mounted above the three searchlights,
but in the axis itself. It is so disposed that its flash comes
midway between any of the two below, and it is arranged
to rotate three times as quickly as the main group of lights.
Accordingly, the duration of the flash thrown from the
fourth searchlight is only one-third of the flash thrown by
the others&mdash;that is, one-thirtieth of a second. This lamp
is provided with all the necessary mechanism for keeping
it in steady rotation at the increased speed, and for drawing
current from its feed-cable.</p>

<p>Before the installation was placed in the lighthouse at
Heligoland, it was submitted to searching tests at the
Nuremberg works of the builders. These trials proved that
with a current of only 26 ampères the average intensity
was as high as 34,000,000 candle-power, with a maximum
of nearly 40,000,000 candle-power; while with 34 ampères
the average intensity rose to approximately 40,000,000,
with a maximum of nearly 43,000,000 candle-power. Accordingly,
the terms of the contract were fulfilled completely.</p>

<p>The searchlights throw their rays from a massive conical
tower, the focal plane of which is 272 feet above sea-level.
In average weather the rays are visible at a distance of
twenty-three nautical miles, and under the most advantageous
weather conditions visibility is limited only by the
curvature of the earth, although on a clear night the light
is seen from Büsun, which is about thirty-five miles away.
The Heligoland electric light ranks as a remarkable development
in the application of electricity to lighthouse illumination,
but it never has been duplicated. The cost of maintenance&mdash;about
£1,400, or $8,000, per annum&mdash;is an
insuperable handicap.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Hornum electric light, which is
the most modern of its type in Germany, is more economical,
although by no means so powerful. The tower is of cast-steel,
and carries two electric lights; while about half a mile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
distant is a second tower, which throws a third electric
light. In the main tower, on the ground floor, is installed
the electric generating plant (in duplicate), together with
all accessories, such as switchboards, etc. The floor above
is devoted to housing 100 accumulators, which are charged
during the day. This task can be completed by one generating
set in about six hours. A single charge is sufficient
to keep the three lights going for ten or eleven hours, and
the lights are controlled by a simple throw-over switch.
By this arrangement the cost of the maintenance of the light
is reduced very appreciably, as only one keeper is on duty
at a time, the station being equipped with two men, who
have proved adequate for the purpose.</p>

<p>Above the accumulator-room is the storeroom and a
general workshop, followed by a bedroom and above that
the service-room. As only one keeper is on duty at a
time, he is provided with ample devices whereby he can
summon his comrade in times of emergency; the generating
machinery is also controllable from this floor. From the
service-room the lower light-room is entered. This is a
secondary or back light in the range, the front light being
in the tower half a mile away. Each of these two light-rooms
is fitted with two 150 candle-power incandescent
electric lights, but only one is burned in each set at a time:
the second is a reserve. Should the light in action fail from
any cause, although the keeper is warned of the occurrence,
he does not have to stir a finger to bring the reserve light
into service. The short-circuit produced by the accident
to the light automatically revolves the table upon which
the lamps are mounted, swings the reserve light into focus,
and then sets it going.</p>

<p>Above the secondary light in the main tower is the
principal beacon, comprising a brilliant rapidly-flashing
light, the characteristic of which is groups of two flashes
alternating with four flashes, the cycle being completed
once in thirty seconds. The optical apparatus has been
devised especially for the “differential arc-light,” as it is
called, with a reflecting lens having a focal distance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
250 millimetres (10 inches), the lens itself being 1,180 millimetres
(approximately 47 inches) in diameter. In front
of the lens is placed a disperser, having a diameter of
1,200 millimetres (48 inches) whereby the ray of light is
dispersed through an arc of 10½ degrees. Before the disperser
is the means for producing the characteristic flash.
This comprises a blind, or shutter, which is opened and
closed by mechanism adjusted to requirements; while the
rotating mechanism, instead of being weight-driven, is
actuated by an electric motor.</p>

<p>The “differential arc,” which is utilized in this installation,
is considered by German engineers to be the best
system that has yet been devised for the exacting purposes
of lighthouse engineering, and the description has
arisen from the disposition of the carbons. While the
positive carbon is held horizontally, the negative carbon is
placed at an angle of 70 degrees thereto, and only the
crater of the positive carbon is considered for the lighting
effect, this being placed in the focus of the apparatus.
The positive carbon is <span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub></span> inch, and the negative carbon
<span class="fraction"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></span> inch, in diameter, although both have a common length
of 19 inches, which is sufficient for nine hours’ service.
The beam emitted is of some 5,000,000 candle-power. This
is one of the cheapest electric stations at present in operation,
the annual running charges averaging less than £300,
or $1,500.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME LIGHTHOUSES IN AUSTRALIAN WATERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Although the waters washing the Australian continent are
not so thickly intersected with steamship lanes, and the
mercantile traffic is not so dense there as in the seas of the
Northern Hemisphere, yet, owing to the activity in emigration
from Great Britain, as well as to the increasing prosperity
of the various rising industries under the Southern Cross,
they are becoming more crowded with each succeeding year.
The efficient lighting of the coasts is an inevitable corollary
of this expansion. Lighthouse engineering, however, is
unavoidably expensive, especially when sea-rocks demand
indication.</p>

<p>From time to time severe strictures are passed by
European shipping interests upon the apparent lack of
coastal lights in Australasian waters, and the various
Government departments concerned with this responsibility
are often accused of parsimony and neglect. Unfortunately,
the greater number of these critics are apt to consider the
situation through European glasses; to take the countries
of the Old World and the United States as a basis for their
arguments, and to ignore local conditions. It has taken a
century or more for Europe and the United States to develop
their respective organizations, and in the majority of
instances there are ample funds from which expenses in
this direction may be met, especially when passing shipping
is mulcted a small sum in light-dues for the purpose. When
the shipping is heavy, these levies are certain to represent in
the aggregate a large sum every year.</p>

<p>From time to time New Zealand has been roundly assailed
for its apparent negligence in the extension of its lighthouse
system. It maintains thirty-four lighthouses and beacons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
which represent a capital outlay of over £200,000, or
$1,000,000. The total maintenance charges average about
£16,500, or $82,000, per annum, while the dues collected
from shipping for the maintenance of these aids to navigation
approximate £38,000, or $190,000, per annum. The balance
is not amazing, and certainly is not sufficient to warrant
heavy expenditure towards new lights, as the installation of
such warnings nowadays is highly expensive if they are to
conform with modern requirements. If the demands of
the critics were met, and a comprehensive scheme, such as
is advised, were taken in hand, the shipowner would have
to pay to meet the deficiency on the revenue account, and
this individual complains that he is overtaxed already.</p>

<p>Those Australian States which possess what may be
described as a normal coastline&mdash;that is, one fairly free
from solitary rocks rising from the sea some distance from
land&mdash;are fortunate, since the sea-rock light is notoriously
costly. On the other hand, lights placed on the mainland,
even of the most powerful type, may be completed for a
small outlay, relatively speaking.</p>

<p>Such a fortunate condition exists in connection with New
South Wales. Here and there off the mainland are small
reefs and ridges, but, taken on the whole, all these danger
spots are adequately covered, so that the State has not been
faced with searching problems of a technical or financial
character in this connection. The State boasts only two
“rock” lighthouses, and these obstructions are large
enough to be called “islands.” The one is South Solitary
Island, off the coast north of Sydney; the other is Montague
Island, to the south of the port. On the other hand, the
mainland is very well patrolled, some thirty lights being
scattered between Point Danger and Cape Howe, the
respective northern and southern sea-limits of the country.</p>

<p>Although the light-keepers upon the rocks may consider
themselves somewhat isolated, yet their plight is enviable
as compared with that of some of their comrades in other
parts of the world. At Montague Island the three keepers
and their families are housed in comfortable cottages in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
close proximity to their ward, and they maintain a small
farm, including a horse, goats, well-stocked gardens, and so
forth. The keepers on South Solitary Island used to be
able to vary the monotony of their daily or nightly round
by indulgence in exciting sport. This assumed the form of
rabbit trapping and hunting, as the island was overrun with
these animals. One form of game must have become somewhat
nauseating in time upon the menu of the keepers, but
this diversion is now a thing of the past. A mysterious
disease appeared among the rabbits, and its ravages were
so devastating that within a short time Montague Island
knew them no more.</p>

<p>The lighthouses of New South Wales deserve distinction
in one direction. As specimens of architecture they are
magnificent pieces of work, so that what the towers lack
in romance they make up in attractiveness. The most
imposing is the Macquarie tower, or Sydney lighthouse,
mounting guard over the harbour. The first beacon was
erected upon this site as far back as 1816, thereby rendering
it the first lighthouse in the State, and it was fitted with an
oil light, while one or two of the English lights were still
open coal fires. In 1883 it was decided to modernize the
lighting apparatus, so that a more powerful beam might
be thrown. Electricity was the illuminant selected, the
machinery for the generation of the requisite current being
designed for installation in the original tower. But three-quarters
of a century’s exposure to the elements had rendered
this building somewhat too weak to carry the requisite
heavy lenses and machinery, so a new tower was projected.
The old light was kept going while its successor sprang up
alongside; when the latter was completed, the oil light in
the famous old tower was extinguished for ever and the
building demolished.</p>

<p>The new lighthouse is a fine structure. At the foot of the
tower is a spacious, well-lighted, and artistic one-floor building
housing the electrical machinery as well as the office.
The domiciles for the keepers and the engineers are placed
on either side of the spreading lawn surrounding the station.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THREE STRIKING GUARDIANS OF THE SHORE OF NEW SOUTH WALES.</p>

<p class="captionc">1. Green Cape Lighthouse. 2. The sentinel of Sugar Loaf Point, or Seal Rocks. 3. “Bungaree Norah” station, one of the loneliest
on the coast.</p></div></div>

<p>The most southerly light upon the New South Wales
coastline is that at Green Cape, a few miles north of Cape
Howe. As at the other stations, three keepers are maintained,
being accommodated, with their families, in roomy
cottages; while a small patch of land is turned to agricultural
advantage, cows, horses, etc., being maintained by the
men. The most easterly light on the Australian continent
is at Cape Byron. This light is perched on a dangerous cliff,
which drops almost vertically into the water 371 feet below;
but it is within touch of civilization, a winding road having
been cut down the flank of the promontory on the land side
into the neighbouring town of Byron Bay, so that the
tradesmen’s carts are able to make their rounds up the cliff
to satisfy the varied wants of the wardens of the light.
One of the loneliest lights is that on Norah Head&mdash;Bungaree
Norah it is called&mdash;and this is also the latest light
erected by the State, as it dates from 1903. Although
somewhat out of the way, it is not to be compared with
some of the isolated British, Canadian, and United States
lights, being, in fact, no more inaccessible or lonely than
most localities in the Australian Bush.</p>

<p>Sugar-Loaf Point is one of the most serious danger spots
along the shoreline, but is now well guarded with a fine
lighthouse planted on its summit, the welcome rays of
which are visible for many miles out to sea. The light-keepers
here had a surprising discovery one morning in
1910. The <i>Satara</i> fouled the point and was wrecked,
though fortunately her passengers were succoured by passing
steamers. On this vessel at the time of the disaster there
was a staghound, and although, when the rescues were
effected, search for the animal was made high and low on the
wreck, no signs of it could be seen. It was given up as lost.
Some days later the lighthouse-keepers ventured to the
beach below to have a look round, and to their astonishment
a staghound come bounding towards them, yelping with
joy at the sight of a human face. For a dog to be in such a
lonely spot was a strange circumstance, but at last it was
surmised to be the animal which was missed on the <i>Satara</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Apparently the animal clung to the crippled craft for some
time, and then, realizing that the ship was abandoned, dived
overboard and swam ashore. It fraternized with the
keepers, and for some time kept them company at the
station.</p>

<p>One of the worst wrecks which have happened upon the
shores of New South Wales was that of the steamer <i>Ly-ce-moon</i>.
By some inexplicable means the ship got out of her
course on a fine Sunday night, and came to grief off Green
Cape. The lighthouse-keepers at once hurried to the rescue,
the hapless passengers, as they were got ashore, being tended
at the station until they were removed to their homes. The
lighthouse-keepers worked tremendously hard, but they
were not entirely successful. Although by herculean effort
they brought a large number of people to safety, there is a
small fenced enclosure in the Bush behind the station where
lie the remains of some fifty persons who lost their lives in
the wreck, and whose bodies were washed ashore.</p>

<p>While New South Wales has a comparatively easy length
of coastline to protect, the neighbouring colony of New
Zealand, on the other hand, has a wild, forbidding, and
extensive stretch of shore. Up to the present the Government
has concentrated its energies upon the illumination of
the busiest reaches of water, and has planted prominent
outposts at the respective extreme tips of the twin islands.
During the financial year ending March 31, 1912, sixteen
wrecks occurred in these seas, of which six were total losses.
The most ill-famed corner appears to be the large sweeping
indentation at the southern end of North Island, lying
between Cape Egmont and Wellington, particularly in the
vicinity of Wanganui, since this stretch of coast claimed
five victims. Cook’s Strait, which is dangerous to navigators,
is well protected, however, the most prominent
beacon being that on Stephens Island, its group-flashes,
occurring every thirty seconds, being particularly powerful,
and having a range of thirty-two miles.</p>

<p>The Marine Department maintains thirty-two coastal
lights, of which twenty-two are on the mainland, and ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
situate on islands off the coast. They are of a varied
description, ranging from powerful lights of the first order
to beacons dependent upon dissolved acetylene, stored in
cylinders of sufficient capacity to keep the light gleaming
for sixty days continuously. Some of the places in which
the warning lights are placed are exceedingly lonely
and inaccessible, so that the perfection of the unattended
light has solved a complex problem, and has enabled
many terrible stretches of forbidding coast to be well
indicated.</p>

<p>PAINTING THE TROUBRIDGE LIGHTHOUSE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</p>

<p class="captionl">Keeping the building in repair is one of the lighthouse-keepers’ duties. This is especially urgent in
the case of an iron structure. This tower is 78 feet high, the light being visible for 15 miles.</p></div></div>

<p>The first tower to be brought into service in New Zealand
was that on Pencarrow Head, to indicate the entrance to
the inlet in which Wellington nestles. It shed its rays for
the first time on New Year’s Day, 1859. It is an iron structure,
from the top of which a fixed white light may be picked
up by a vessel twenty-seven miles off the coast. The iron
had to be prepared and shaped in England, as there was
no foundry in the islands at that time capable of executing
the work. The building was shipped to New Zealand in
sections and erected. To-day, owing to the growth of the
iron industry, the country can supply all its own needs
in this field without difficulty, but in all cases the lanterns,
mechanism, and lenses, have to be acquired in
Europe.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, with such a rugged coastline as
New Zealand possesses, some of the stations are terribly
lonely and difficult of access, owing to the treacherous nature
of the waters over which they mount guard. With the
exception of the Brothers light, which is situated on an
exposed rock in Cook’s Strait, three keepers are maintained
at each island lighthouse&mdash;one as relief&mdash;and at the more
isolated mainland lights. Those of the latter stations which
are within easy reach of civilization have only two keepers.
The Brothers light, which is New Zealand’s most lonely
station, has four keepers, three on the rock at one time,
while the fourth is ashore. The spell of service on the rock
is three months, followed by one month’s leave. The
wives and families of the men reside at Wellington. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
authorities, however, do not condemn the light-keeper to
one station throughout his whole term of service. He
undergoes frequent transference, so that all may have a
turn at good and bad stations. The duration of the stay at
each light averages about three years, so that there is very
little possibility of these patient, long-suffering stalwarts
being condemned to such a period of loneliness as to
provoke taciturnity and melancholia.</p>

<p>The keeper of the lighthouse light in New Zealand is as
well provided for as his colleague in any other part of the
world. When he enters the service, he is placed on probation
as assistant keeper for six months, at an annual salary of
£90, or $450. Emerging from this ordeal satisfactorily, he
finds his salary increased at once to £100, or $500, per
annum, rising by increments of £10 every two years, until
it reaches £130, or $650, per annum. It remains at this
figure until he is promoted to the position of head-keeper,
which post brings an annual wage of £140, or $700, rising
by biennial increments of £10 to a maximum annual remuneration
of £180, or $900. In addition to the foregoing
scale, a keeper receives an extra annual station allowance of
£10 in the case of third-class stations, which are those on
lonely rocks and islands, and £5 in the case of stations which
are not isolated or difficult of access. All keepers in the
service live rent-free, and are supplied with coal and oil,
together with the free use of sufficient land, if available, to
prepare gardens, as well as grazing for two or three cows
and a few sheep, etc.; while their stores and provisions are
carried without charge by the Government steamer <i>Hinemoa</i>.
This vessel is retained solely for attending upon the lighthouses
and buoys, and visits every light, save in exceptionally
rough weather, once in three months.</p>

<p>At all the isolated and rock stations landing is a hazardous
task, even under the most favourable conditions. The swell
and currents breaking upon the rocks render it impossible
for freight and men to be landed direct from the steamer
to the rock. Consequently all the work has to be carried out
by means of surf-boats, and heavy drenchings from breaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
waves, and exciting moments, are unavoidable. At times
the task assumes exceptional difficulty, and is attended
with fatal mishaps. On June 2, 1899, the <i>Hinemoa</i> stood
in towards the East Cape, the most easterly promontory on
the islands, on the southern arm enclosing the Bay of Plenty.
The sea looked wicked, but the relieving ship decided to go
ahead with its work. All went well until a heavy roller
suddenly came in and caught one of the boats at a disadvantage.
The craft was capsized before the crew realized
their position, and the chief officer, with three of his men,
was drowned. Such is one of the penalties which have
been exacted by the relentless sea, while courageous
men have been engaged in the risky occupation of keeping
the coast lights shining for the guidance of seafarers.</p>

<p>The New Zealand shores have been the scenes of some
heartrending catastrophes. The steamship <i>Tararua</i>, of
563 tons register, was making her way from Dunedin to the
Bluff, when she crashed on to the reef which juts seaward
from Waipapapa Point. There was no light to warn the
ship&mdash;hence the accident. The vessel, battered by sledge-hammer
seas, broke up very rapidly, and 130 passengers
lost their lives. If the point had been guarded, no accident
would have happened. Now a second-order dioptric flashing
light of ten seconds guards the reef, and may be seen from
a distance of thirteen and a half miles. Another calamity
was the loss of the <i>Huddart Parker</i> liner on a danger spot
known as the Three Kings Rock. The fearsome character
of this peril has been recognized for many years past, but,
as it is to be marked by a light suited to the locality, it is
hoped that its evil harvest will come to an end. Yet at
the same time it must be pointed out that the provision of
a light does not always prevent a wreck even in the clearest
weather, owing to the weakness of human nature. This
was proved by the steamship <i>Triumph</i>, of 1,797 tons register.
She left Auckland on the night of November 29, 1883,
picked up the Tiri-Tiri Island light&mdash;this fixed star can be
seen from a distance of twenty-four miles&mdash;and yet within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
two hours of her sailing was wrecked almost under the lighthouse.
In this instance gross negligence was only too
palpable, and the court of inquiry, after its investigation
of the wreck, signified its opinion of the carelessness displayed
by suspending the certificate of the master for three
years, and that of the chief officer for six months.</p>

<p>Apart from Cook’s Strait, the narrow passage between the
two islands, the extreme points of the country are well
guarded, the towers for the most part being located upon
the prominent headlands. The southern extremity of the
South Island is a dangerous coast to navigate, since going
east, after the Puysegur Point ten seconds flashing light is
dropped at a distance of nineteen miles from the headland,
the vessel’s course is set to traverse Foveaux Strait, between
the mainland and Stewart Island. In the centre of the
neck of water is an ominous rock, Centre Island, which,
however, is well guarded by a first-order catadioptric fixed
light, shining from a wooden tower, the range of which
extends for twenty-two and a half miles, with red arcs
marking the inshore dangers. Overlapping this beacon’s
field of patrol is a light mounted on Dog Island, revolving
once in thirty seconds, and visible for eighteen miles, which
in turn meets the Waipapapa light. Thus the approach to
Invercargill is well indicated, and, with the east coast
promontories all protected, the possibility of a repetition
of the <i>Tararua</i> disaster is rendered remote.</p>

<p>On the extreme northern tip of the sister isle, the headland
known as Cape Maria Van Diemen carries a first-order
dioptric light, revolving once a minute, illuminating a circle
of sea having a radius of twenty-four and a half miles. The
adjacent headland at the opposite corner of this spit, North
Cape, has not been protected hitherto; but this deficiency
is now being remedied by the erection of a second-order,
incandescent, group-flashing white light, giving three
flashes in quick succession every half-minute. The brilliant
illumination of this part of the coast is imperative, inasmuch
as shipping bound for and from Auckland has to bear round
this heavily indented and rock-strewn coast. The entrance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
to Auckland harbour in particular is disconcerting, but
the navigator is assisted by the friendly guardians placed on
Cape Brett, Moko Hinou, and Tiri-Tiri, which have ranges
of thirty and a half, twenty-six, and twenty-four miles,
respectively. The task of the mariner, however, is to be
further simplified by the erection of another powerful light
on Chicken Island, in the Hauraki Gulf, which will overlap
the Moko Hinou and Tiri-Tiri lights. When this light and
that at North Cape are placed in commission, the sea
between Cape Maria Van Diemen and Auckland will be very
well lighted, and will offer the ship’s master few causes for
complaint. Two other points are being equipped, Castle
Point and Cape Terawhiti, the former with a second-order,
incandescent, group-flashing white light, flashing at intervals
of forty-five seconds, with periods of darkness lasting
eight seconds between each group.</p>

<p>While the majority of the New Zealand coastal lights
are attended, certain beacons, from their exposed position,
come in the category of unattended lights, as described elsewhere.
These burn acetylene gas, and are replaced with
fresh supplies of dissolved acetylene every three months by
the <i>Hinemoa</i>. Simultaneously with the provision of additional
beacons the existing lights are being overhauled and
fitted with modern apparatus, rendering them more reliable,
economical, and of greater power. When the service was
established, the Doty burner, using paraffin-oil, was adopted;
but the perfection of the incandescent oil system, and its
many advantages over that in vogue, have influenced the
Government towards its adoption. The transformation
will be completed as soon as practicable, the work being in
active progress, as maintenance expenses are reduced
appreciably thereby, because kerosene, a cheaper oil, is used
in lieu of paraffin, while, furthermore, less oil is burned under
the incandescent system.</p>

<p>Before many years have passed, the coasts of New Zealand
will be as adequately protected as is humanly possible by
a complete chain of coastal lights, which is being forged as
rapidly as the circumstances permit. The Government has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
revised its light-dues in order to meet the increased expenditure
in connection with the lighthouse service. Vessels
arriving from outside the Dominion have to pay oversea
light-dues at the first port of call, and coastal dues at all
other New Zealand ports which they touch; while vessels
arriving from the Chatham, Auckland, Campbell, Antipodes,
and Bounty Islands also have to contribute to the funds.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SIGNPOSTS OF THE SANDBANKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Although by dint of great effort and the expenditure of
considerable ingenuity the lighthouse engineer has succeeded
in erecting a permanent masonry tower upon a
foundation no more substantial than quicksand, yet the
general method of indicating these menaces is by the aid
of a lightship. In this way the estuaries leading to the
great ports of the world, which are littered with ridges,
humps, and mounds, of mud and sand brought down by the
river or thrown up by the sea, are guarded very completely.
There is the Nore lightship at the entrance to the
Thames, the Bar and North-West lightships off the mouth of
the Mersey, Fire Island near the portal to New York, and
so on. Similarly, the whereabouts of huge stretches of sand
lying off a coast, which either defy detection altogether or
only partially expose themselves at low-water, and which
constitute certain death-traps, are shown. The most striking
illustrations of this application are supplied by the Goodwin
Sands, the submerged sandy plateau lying off the east coast
of England, and by the serried rows of ridges running seven
and a half miles out to sea from Cape Hatteras, the ill-famed
headland of North Carolina.</p>

<p>The utilization of the lightship, however, is not restricted
by any means to marking shoals and sandbanks. Here and
there are clusters of rocks obstructing the ocean highway,
which from their extremely exposed character would offer
the engineer a searching and expensive problem to solve,
and which, accordingly, are protected by a floating light.
But, taken on the whole, the lightship is used very sparingly.
If it is at all possible to provide a permanent structure, even
at an apparently prohibitive cost, upon a danger spot, this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
practice is followed in preference to the mooring of a light-vessel
thereto. A masonry tower is stationary in its
resistance to the assaults of the wildest tempest, but the
lightship swings like a cork at the free end of a chain. At
times it drags its anchors, and thereby unconsciously shifts
its position, so that it may throw its light from some distance
beyond the actual area of danger. Again, a lightship,
although not costly in the first instance, is somewhat expensive
to maintain. It cannot withstand the poundings
of the waves and the force of the wind for long without
developing some signs of weakness. It may ride over its
reef or shoal for several years, but depreciation is sure to
set in, so that at last it becomes too decrepit to be trusted.
Moreover, the number of men required to man a lightship
exceeds the force necessary to maintain a lighthouse.</p>

<p>Lightships follow much the same general shape and construction
the whole world over. There is very little opportunity
to depart from well-tried lines; the experience of a
century and more has indicated conclusively the form of
hull, as regards both material and shape, best adapted to
the peculiar work which has to be fulfilled. The modern
lightship is essentially a British idea, the first floating beacon
of this description having been built and placed in the
mouth of the Thames as far back as 1713. From this small
beginning, which virtually was an experiment, has grown
the large fleet of light-vessels scattered all over the globe.</p>

<p>The craft is sturdily built, and, although of clumsy appearance,
is capable of withstanding the onslaughts of the fiercest
gales. Internally it is made as snug as possible, but the
opportunities in this direction are not very extensive, as
the beacon is built primarily to protect ships and lives
against accident, and comfort is necessarily made subordinate
to reliability, durability, and serviceability.</p>

<p>A mere hulk would be the most apt description as applied
to the average lightship. It is intended to cling to one spot
through thick and thin, and not to move about. In the
majority of instances the vessel is without any propelling or
sailing accessories. If it should happen to break its leashes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
it then becomes the sport of the waves, as helpless as a
derelict, until its signals of distress are espied and it is
picked up by a passing vessel. Although every precaution
is adopted to preserve the lightship from this mishap, when
the waves become exceptionally heavy and violent the
strongest chains are apt to snap under the sawing and
tugging of the vessel. In one or two instances lively times
have been experienced by the handful of men on board,
especially off the wicked stretches of the American seaboard
which is exposed to the attack of hurricane and cyclone.</p>

<p>THE “SEVEN-STONES” LIGHTSHIP.</p>

<p class="captionc">This vessel, probably occupying the most exposed position around England, marks a terrible danger spot off the Cornish coast.</p></div></div>

<p>In her helplessness, the light-vessel depends upon the
friendly aid of any craft. The rescuer may be the alert
tender, which, having received intimation that the floating
beacon has got adrift, raises steam in all haste, hurries out,
scours the seas for the wanderer, recovers and rechains her
to the danger spot below. Or it may be that a passing·
steamer sights the breakaway, retrieves and restores her to
the allotted position, making her temporarily secure, and
reporting her condition when passing or entering a port.</p>

<p>The lightship may be identified easily. There is nothing
inspiring about her lines. Her ugly hull, built for strength
and not beauty, is painted red, black, or white, according to
the colour practice of the country to which she belongs, while
on her sides in huge letters, stretching almost from water-line
to taffrail, is the name of her station, “Nore,” “Seven
Stones,” “Norderney,” “Ruytingen,” “Fire Island,” or
whatever it may be. Nor is this the sole means of identification.
From afar the mariner learns her character and
business by a huge skeleton sphere, a triangular cage, or some
other device, carried at the top of the mast or masts. At
night a lantern, entirely surrounding the mast, and large
enough to enable a person to stand upright within to trim
the lamps, throws its warning glare from an elevation about
halfway between the deck and the mast-top with the intensity
of 12,000 or more candles. Oil is the illuminant
most generally employed for the purpose, although in one or
two instances electric light is used.</p>

<p>The specific purpose of the lightship, as already mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
is to warn passing vessels. But the French Government,
when they made an elaborate investigation of their
lightship service with a view to its modernization and
elaboration, discovered that at times the floating signpost
fulfils another and unofficial duty. The entrance to St. Malo
Harbour is flanked by an uneven group of rocks lying about
midway between the French coast and the island of Jersey.
Though a terrible spot for mariners, it is one of incalculable
value to the sturdy French and Jersey fishermen, as in the
waters around these barriers rich hauls may be made with
the net; indeed, the fishing industry here affords employment
for several score of persons. The French Government
contemplated the withdrawal of the lightship marking the
Minquiers, as these rocks are called, and the substitution in
its stead of a number of powerful automatic buoys which
would indicate the exact position of the most conspicuous
dangers, whereas the lightship only indicated their general
whereabouts, compelling mariners to calculate their distances
from the peril, which, by the way, was no easy matter owing
to the short range of the beacon.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE “SAN FRANCISCO” LIGHTSHIP.</p>

<p class="captionc">This vessel, riding in 18 fathoms, marks the entrance to the Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay.</p></div></div>

<p>Before making a decision, the Commission interviewed the
French fishermen to ascertain their views upon the subject.
To their intense surprise, a suggestion which they thought
would be received with unmixed approval was condemned
unequivocally. There was not a single fisherman who
could be found to support the buoy system. The unanimity
of the objection aroused suspicions, and further investigation
was made to probe the cause of this unveiled hostility. The
answer was found without effort. The fishermen pushed
off in their boats every night to the grounds, but they did
not spend the whole of their time throwing and hauling their
nets. When their luck was in, or they were satisfied with
the catch, one and all pulled for the lightship. There was
not another café within a dozen miles, and fishing is thirsty
work. So the lightship was converted into a nocturnal
hostelry. The keepers charged the glasses, and the captains
courageous sipped and quaffed to a whistling accompaniment,
finally indulging in terpsichorean acts on the lightship’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
decks, to give vent to their exuberant spirits. They
did not care whether the light overhead were throwing its
yellow beams over the waters or not. They made merry,
and kept up the orgy until the approaching dawn or the
watch showed that it was high time to pull for the shore
with their catches. It was a fortunate circumstance for
these happy-go-lucky spirits that the beacon was not
regarded by mariners as of much utility at night, owing to
the feebleness of its light. If seafarers failed to pick up
the Minquiers’s shimmering star, they attributed the obscurity
to the haze. That was all.</p>

<p>This revelation, needless to say, clinched the Commission’s
decision. To-day four unattended gas-buoys mount vigil
over these rocks, and the rollicking days on the floating <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">café
chantant</i> are known no more.</p>

<p>The average crew for a lightship numbers some seven men
under a captain and mate, who take it in turns to have
charge of the vessel, the second official being responsible
during the former’s spell of leave on shore. The crew is not
a man too many, owing to the several and varied duties to
be performed, especially when the storm-fiend is roused or
fog pays a visit. The arrival of the latter demands the foghorn’s
mournful dirge to penetrate the dense white curtain.
Some of the vessels possess a hooter, the unmusical wail of
which in its discordance is almost sufficient to put false
teeth on edge, because a blast runs through the whole
chromatic gamut with variations which would startle a
disciple of Tschaikowsky or Wagner. But discordance in
this instance is of incalculable value. The ear of the captain
of a passing vessel is unconsciously arrested; he can distinguish
the sound readily, and by noting its character can
identify the particular light-vessel from which it proceeds,
although he cannot get a glimpse of her form.</p>

<p>The southern coasts of England, owing to the density of
the maritime traffic, especially on both sides of the bottle-neck
formed by the Straits of Dover, are well patrolled by
this form of warning which supplements the lighthouses.
Those guarding the dreaded Goodwin Sands perhaps are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the most important. The crew of a vessel in these waters
is busy throughout the day and night even in calm, clear
weather, and the feeling of isolation is not so pronounced,
since the continuous sight of traffic dispels despondency. The
Nore light is another station which encounters very few
minutes of rest throughout the complete revolution of the
clock hands; especially is this the case when fog settles
down, rendering the Thames inapproachable, so that incoming
craft have to line up in long queues, ready to dash
forward directly the pall lifts sufficiently for them to see
100 yards ahead.</p>

<p>There have been some exciting incidents among the
lights strung around the south-eastern toe of England.
The vessel outside Dover harbour appears to be particularly
unlucky, or to exercise such a peculiar magnetism upon
passing vessels that they must needs embrace her. This
is the peril that a lightship crew dreads more than any other.
Certainly it seems a sorry trick of Fortune that occasionally
the workers in the cause of humanity should be compelled to
fight desperately for their lives from a blow inflicted by the
very interests they strive might and main to protect. The
Dover light was sent to the bottom twice within a very
short time, and in each instance the men were rescued only
in the nick of time. On another occasion a relief lightship
was being towed to a station on the east coast, the acting
vessel being much in need of overhaul and repair. The
tug laboured through the North Sea with her charge, and
just before daybreak sighted the twinkling light which was
her goal. She eased up, meaning to stand by with her
charge until the beacon’s round of vigilance should be over,
and the light extinguished before the gathering dawn. Her
crew saw the light grow dimmer, until it was no longer of
sufficient power to penetrate the whitening haze. With the
sun just creeping over the horizon the tug weighed anchor,
and, heralding her approach vociferously on the siren,
steamed slowly towards the danger spot. To the surprise
of the captain, there came no answering blare. When he
thought he was alongside the light-vessel he stopped, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the haze lifted. But there was no sign of the light-vessel;
she had vanished completely. The captain of the tug and
the master of the relief-boat wondered what had happened,
but without more ado the relief-ship was moored in position,
and the tug returned home empty-handed. There the crew
heard one of those grim stories sometimes related in the
service. The light-keepers had sighted the tug with the
relief-vessel, and were anticipating keenly their return to
civilization, when there was a crash! A cliff of steel reared
above them like a knife-edge; a vessel had blundered into
them, cutting their home in two. The next moment they
were shot pell-mell into the water as their craft sank beneath
their feet.</p>

<p>On a calm day, when the lightship is riding quietly at
anchor, and the members of the crew, maybe, are beguiling
the tedium by fishing, a passer-by on a liner is apt to consider
the life one of quietness and enjoyment, albeit monotonous.
But contrast this placidity with the hours of storm. Then
the ungainly vessel writhes and twists, saws and rasps at the
chains which hold her prisoner. At one moment, with bow
uplifted, she is on the crest of a spray-enveloped roller; the
next instant she drives her dipping nose into the hissing
white and green valley, meanwhile lurching and staggering
wildly as she ships a sea, first on this side and then on that.</p>

<p>The plight of the lighthouse-keeper in a gale is unenviable,
but it is far and away preferable to that of the lightship
crew under similar circumstances. The tower may bow
slightly like a tree before the storm, and the waves may
cause it to shiver at times, but that is the only movement.
On the lightship the crew appear to be tossed, rolled, and
spun, in all directions simultaneously. The deck becomes
untenable, but the men in the performance of their duties
have to grope and crawl from point to point, holding on
grimly with both hands when an angry sea douches them.
The spherical ball overhead gyrates in an amazing manner,
as if it were a pendulum bob boxing the compass. The crew
have a stiff struggle, to keep everything below safe and
sound, while the waves, as they come aboard, thump on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
deck as if determined to smash it to splinters, and to drive
the whole fabric to the bottom. To be so unlucky as to be
run down by a passing craft under such conditions is certain
death, as there is no hope of rescue in such maddened seas.</p>

<p>The crew of an English ship emerged badly battered from
one heavy gale. Two or three rollers got aboard, and drove
their blows well home, pulverizing the lifeboat on deck, and
tearing up stretches of the bulwarks by the roots. The
crew were flung about like shuttlecocks. One of the hands
was making his way cautiously along the deck, trying to
maintain equilibrium upon an alarming incline, when a
breaker struck him from behind. He grabbed the ratlins to
secure himself, but his hand was wrenched away, and he
was flung against the mast, where the wave left him. He
was half stunned by the concussion, but a comrade, realizing
his plight, dashed forward while the vessel rolled over in the
other direction, grabbed the prostrate form by the collar of
its coat, and dragged it into the companion-way. The man’s
face was disfigured, and when bathed it was found to have
been cut, or rather burst, open from the eye to the chin by
the force of the blow.</p>

<p>Bad weather tends to make the crew despondent at
times, inasmuch as its persistency holds them prisoners, so
that they cannot get ashore when the relief day comes round.
During some seasons of the year a delay of ten or twelve
days is not uncommon, owing to the weather, but the men
on the relief tender are so used to hard knocks and rough
seas that they do not wait for an absolute calm to achieve
their purpose. Heavy risks are incurred often in order to
lighten the lives of those who guard the deep by bringing
them ashore as near to the scheduled date as possible.</p>

<p>Another ship that has to mount guard over a dangerous
corner of the coast of England is that which indicates the
cluster of rocks lying between Land’s End and the Scilly
Isles, about sixteen miles off the mainland. For the most
part the reef is submerged, but as the water goes down seven
ugly scattered pinnacles thrust themselves into the air.
They are terrible fangs with which to rip out the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
a steamer, and they have accomplished their fell work only
too often. The number of the projections has given its
name to the graveyard, which is known far and wide as the
Seven Stones, though the mariner refers to them simply
as The Stones.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say offhand which has claimed the
greater number of victims from the mercantile marine&mdash;the
sucking, glue-like sands of the Goodwins, or the splitting
granite teeth of the Seven Stones; they run a close race for
ill-fame. The latter lie right in the path of vessels rounding
the western toe of England, and the sea-bed on all sides of
them is littered with the shivered timbers of wooden sailing-ships,
the splintered iron and steel of steamers, and the
bones of scores of unfortunate passengers and crews.
Although a light of 12,000 candle-power strives to warn the
seafarer, now and again there is a miscalculation, and the
intimation is conveyed to the mainland: “Ship and all
hands lost.”</p>

<p>It was in 1841, owing to the frequency and severity of the
disasters at this spot, that Trinity House decided to guard
it with a lightship. A lighthouse would be preferable, but
there is such small foothold for the engineer, and the position
is so fearfully exposed, that the erection of a masonry tower
would prove a costly and tedious enterprise. So the only
feasible alternative was adopted, and the vessel is kept
abreast of modern developments in this phase of coast
lighting. Lying as it does in a somewhat narrow channel,
yet open to the full roll of the terrible westerly gales, it
meets the Atlantic thundering through this constricted
passage with awe-inspiring violence. It has often suffered
greatly from the fury of the sea. Once a wave tumbled
aboard, crashed a man against the pump, knocked him half
senseless; picked up the lifeboat and threw it against the
deck-house, and in so doing caught another member of the
crew, mauling his thigh badly in passing. Two out of the
seven men forming the crew were thus put <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>
by a single wave. The taut little vessel rides in 40 fathoms
of water, about one and a half miles eastward of the danger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
spot, as even a lightship must not be moored too closely to a
ridge, or she herself would incur the risk of being pounded
to fragments.</p>

<p>The French lighthouse service has a magnificent lightship
in the <i>Ruytingen</i>, which rides in 60 feet of water over a
treacherous sandbank outside Dunkirk. It is a steel vessel
about 100 feet in length, and displaces in loaded condition
about 387 tons. It is held in position by massive umbrella-like
anchors, weighing some 2 tons, which, burying themselves
in the ground, refuse to drag even under the most
fearful tugs and jerks imposed by a gale, while the chains
which hold the ship in leash are able to give her a run of
approximately 1,000 feet.</p>

<p>The German coast is as dangerous to approach, owing to
the shoals and banks, as the eastern shores of England, and
one or two magnificent lightships have been built and
stationed over the most notorious danger areas, among
which may be mentioned the <i>Norderney</i> and <i>Eider</i> vessels.
The latter is about 133 feet in length by 24 feet wide, and is
fitted with three masts. It throws a fixed white light, which
may be seen on all sides from eight to eleven miles away.
This boat is fitted with every modern device to increase its
warning powers and service, including wireless telegraphy
and the submarine bell.</p>

<p>These two latter inventions have improved the serviceability
of the lightship to a vast degree, inasmuch as the
ocean liners and many freighters are equipped with both
these useful handmaids to navigation. The tolling of the
bell under water may be heard for several miles, and conveys
intimation of the approach to danger in foggy weather,
when the siren or other fog-signal is somewhat precarious.</p>

<p>The <i>Norderney</i> lightship is probably one of the finest craft
in operation upon the seven seas. Before it was designed
the German engineers carried out a thorough inspection of
all the most modern lightships in service in Europe, and
from the results of their investigations contrived this magnificent
aid to navigation. The vessel is about 150 feet in
length, and is built of steel. The light is shown from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
lantern fitted with a third-order pendular lens carried at
the top of a hollow steel mast. The illuminant used is
Pintsch’s oil-gas, with incandescent mantle, the fuel being
stored in reservoirs stowed in the hold of the ship; fresh
supplies are brought out by the tender at periodical intervals.
Weight-driven clockwork mechanism is employed to revolve
the lantern. The light is one of the most powerful in
European waters, 50,000 candle-power being emitted with
an incandescent gas mantle having a diameter of 30 millimetres
(1¼ inches).</p>

<p class="captionc">One of the finest in the world.</p></div></div>

<p>The vessel is also equipped with 200 horse-power oil-engines,
driving an air-compressor for the operation of the
fog-siren, the air being stored in reservoirs in the hold and
maintained at the working pressure, so that the signal may
be brought into service at a moment’s notice. The vessel is
also furnished with a Pintsch submarine bell, driven by
compressed air. When not required, this bell is housed
amidships on the spar-deck, and when the occasion arises
for its service it is lowered into the water through an open
tube built in the ship for this purpose. This important
light-vessel carries a full complement of thirteen men,
including the captain, mate, and engineer. The arrangement
is, one-third of the crew on shore-leave at a time; but
this does not apply to the winter months, when the full
number has to remain on board, owing to the duties being
more arduous and continuous during that season of the
year.</p>

<p>“Fire Island!” What a thrill the sound of this name
sends through the floating town approaching the New World
from Europe. Its effect is magical among the emigrants
who scan the horizon eagerly for the first glimpse of this outpost
of the new home, in which all their hopes are centred.
The sullen red hull of this flush-deck, schooner-rigged steam-vessel,
with her two masts, and name painted in huge white
letters on her flanks, rides in 96 feet of water, nine and three-eighth
miles south of Fire Island lighthouse. A few miles
beyond is a similar craft marking the Nantucket Shoals,
whence incoming and outgoing vessels are reported, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the end of the chain is “No. 87,” marking the Ambrose
Channel off the entrance to New York.</p>

<p>But the light-vessel controlled by the United States
which occupies the most responsible and perilous post is
the <i>Diamond Shoal</i>, off Cape Hatteras. It throws its warning
rays from a spot about four and five-eighth miles beyond the
most seaward point of this terrible ocean graveyard, and is
thirteen and five-eighth miles distant from Cape Hatteras
light on the mainland. A long way from the actual danger
spot, you say, but the little squad of men who have to
maintain the light through storm and calm will tell you that
the situation, in 180 feet of water, is quite as near as is
pleasant when there is the ever-present danger of anchors
being dragged, or of the craft breaking adrift under the
force of the cyclonic disturbances which ravage this sinister
coast. Even in calm weather the relief-boat has many
anxious moments, owing to the swell and currents, while
storms rise with startling suddenness. While the exchange
of men is being made and stores are being transferred, a keen
lookout is kept by the relief-boat hands so as to be ready to
cut and run for the open sea the moment the clouds begin to
collect ominously. In these latitudes the weather is placid
one minute; the next the elements are writhing in fury.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE “FIRE ISLAND” LIGHTSHIP, THE ATLANTIC OUTPOST OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p class="captionc">This vessel rides in 96 feet of water, 9¾ miles south of the Fire Island Lighthouse.</p></div></div>

<p>Probably this is the most dangerous station on the whole
seaboard, and if any heavy trouble is caused by the tempest,
the <i>Diamond Shoal</i> inevitably bears grim evidence of the
conflict. The skill of the engineers is taxed sorely to devise
ways and means of keeping the vessel in the position she is
designed to occupy, but moorings and anchors must be of
great weight and strength to stand up against a wind blowing
eighty miles an hour, with the waves running “mountains
high” and repeatedly sweeping the vessel from stem to
stern. After every battle a careful look round has to be
made to determine how far the vessel has shifted. Being
steam-driven, this craft is not condemned to absolute helplessness
when her moorings snap. The crew get her under
control and keep her head pointed in the desired direction,
so as to mitigate the battering of the wind and waves, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
not moving more than is essential for safety. Subsequently
the vessel crawls back to her position, the bearings are
taken, and she is anchored firmly once more.</p>

<p>One hurricane swept Cape Hatteras, and the lightship
received its full energy. The boat strained and groaned at
her chains. Suddenly they snapped. No steam could hold
the boat against the assault. She was picked up, thrown
about like an empty box, and carried inshore, luckily missing
the ridges of sand. Had she plumped into one, it would have
gripped her tightly while the waves pounded her to fragments.
The crew were helpless and could only wonder what
the end would be, as they saw the rugged coastline approach
nearer and nearer. When they thought all was over and that
their fate was sealed, a big incoming wave snatched the lightship,
hurried her along on its bosom, and dropped her on the
beach, practically uninjured, and safe from further attack.</p>

<p>When the crew surveyed their position, they found themselves
faced with a difficult proposition. The ship was safe
and sound, but on the wrong side of the shoals, and the
question was how to lift her over those greedy ridges. There
was only one method. That was to dig a pit around her on
the beach, let in the water so that she could float, and then
to cut a wide deep trench out to sea so as to regain deep
water. It was feasible, and was attempted. While the
pond on the beach was being dug, a powerful dredger came
up, and ploughed its way through the shoals from deep water
to the stranded light-vessel. When the craft was once more
afloat, the dredger carved its way back again, the light-vessel
being taken through the narrow, shallow ditch thus
provided, which was closed up by the running sand as the
two boats crept slowly forward, until at last the shoals were
negotiated. The ship was taken to headquarters, the relief-vessel,
which is always kept ready for an emergency, having
taken up her position on the station immediately the
hurricane had blown itself out.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it will be realized that the
maintenance of the <i>Diamond Shoal</i> light is by no means a
sinecure. When these adversities are aggravated by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
relief-boat being unable to fulfil its scheduled duty, when
week after week slips by without the men receiving the
welcome spell ashore, while they are suffering privations
and experiencing the nerve-shattering pangs of isolation and
monotony, it is not surprising that despondency shows signs
of getting the upper hand among the crew. Melancholia is
the malady which is feared most on a light-vessel such as
this, and the men have to pull themselves together to resist
its insidious grip. Probably at times there is half an inclination
to desert the light, but fortunately there is little fear of
this temptation succeeding. The axiom “Never abandon the
light” is too deeply rooted; besides, the men are safer where
they are, although it appears a crazy refuge in rough weather.</p>

<p>Prolonged imprisonment on the <i>Diamond Shoal</i> precipitated
one mutiny. The crew on duty were awaiting the
arrival of the reserve vessel to take them home; but the
weather disposed otherwise. With that inexplicable persistence,
the wind got round to a rough quarter and kept
there tenaciously, never moderating for a few hours, but
just blowing, blowing, blowing, getting up a nasty sea which
made the lightship reel and tumble, while at intervals a
comber came aboard to flush the decks.</p>

<p>In the course of ten days or so the crew began to fret and
fume at the obstinacy of the elements; when a month slipped
by without bringing any welcome relief, the mate and the
engineer incurred the captain’s dire displeasure by fraternizing
and playing cards with the crew, thereby creating a
breach of discipline and etiquette. The offenders, somewhat
overwrought by their continued incarceration, ignored
the captain’s reprimand. This arrant disobedience played
upon his nerves, which similarly were strung up. It did not
require a very big spark to start a conflagration of tempers.
The mate and engineer brooded over the captain’s remarks,
and at last they waited upon him, forcibly ventilated their
opinions concerning his lack of civility and of endeavours to
make one and all comfortable under the trying circumstances,
and expressed their determination to tolerate his
overbearing manner no longer. This was the last straw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
from the captain’s point of view. Drawing his revolver, he
growled that he was master of the lightship, and that they
would have to do as he told them. There was a tussle, but
the firearm was wrenched away from the master’s hands as
being a somewhat too dangerous tool for a man in his overstrung
condition. The crew naturally sided with the
officers, and the captain was kept under surveillance until
the relief-vessel came up some weeks later.</p>

<p>The moment the crew stepped on dry land, every man,
with the exception of the mate, deserted the ship, thoroughly
satiated with the uncertainty pertaining to watching the
Diamond Shoals. They indulged in a hearty carousal, and
were arrested. And the captain, who also was not averse to
enjoyment on shore, having lodged the charge of mutiny,
followed their example. An inquiry was held, and the sequel
is interesting. The captain, having deserted his ship upon
reaching port, was dismissed from the service; the mate,
who had provoked the captain, not only was acquitted of the
grave charge, but was promoted to the command of the light-vessel,
because there was one outstanding feature in his favour
which negatived everything else&mdash;he had stuck to his post.</p>

<p>Life on a lightship, although somewhat strenuous, has
its interludes. In fine weather the men have considerable
time on their hands, and while away the hours in various
occupations. Fretwork, mat-making, carpentering, and other
hobbies, are followed with keen enjoyment. Owing to the
light attracting flocks of birds during the migratory seasons,
the men often effect valuable captures on the deck, rare
songsters and other specimens falling exhausted into their
hands. Cages are contrived, and the silence of the living-quarters
is relieved by the piping and trilling of the birds
when once they have shaken down to their captivity.
Meteorological work, which is practised in some cases,
relieves the round of toil, while contributions to science are
made by investigating the depths of the sea and its bed with
small trawls and other devices, so as to secure data concerning
life in the deep, the vagaries of currents, submarine
temperatures, and so forth.</p>

The lightship, however, is both a safeguard and a menace.
When she is riding quietly at the end of her chains she is an
incalculable boon to the passing mariner, but after a gale
the navigator and the light-keepers are suspicious. The
boat may, and indeed probably has, dragged her anchors
somewhat. Now, the seafarer on his chart has the precise
position which the lightship should occupy. Consequently,
if she has shifted and he is unaware of the error, his calculations
will lead him astray. After a tempest the master of a
lightship endeavours to ascertain if his craft has moved,
and if he can he takes his bearings at once. If this is impossible,
or if he entertains any doubt in his mind, he flies a
signal, which warns the navigator that the lightship has
moved. Unless the vessel is able to regain her station under
her own steam, she communicates with the shore at once,
and a boat is sent out to reset her. Every time the relief is
effected the officer in charge takes the bearings, so that the
lightship may be truly in the position she is intended to
assume, and able to effect her humane work satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The evolution of the most efficient illuminating apparatus
for the lightship has been a most perplexing problem to the
lighthouse engineer. What is applicable for the masonry
tower is not necessarily adapted to its floating contemporary,
since the conditions are so dissimilar. The United States
service has adopted electric lighting on all its steam-driven
vessels, the current being easily obtainable in this instance.
On the whole, however, oil is the most popular form of
illuminant, the burners&mdash;there are several lamps arranged
in a ring round the mast&mdash;being fitted with two circular
wicks, one within the other; while behind the lamp an
ordinary parabolic reflector is placed in order to increase the
intensity of the light produced. These reflectors are disposed
in such a manner around the mast that the concentrated
beam of light from one lamp just overlaps the rays
which are projected similarly from the lamp placed on either
side, the result being that a fixed white light of equal
luminosity throughout the circle is projected. But, unlike
the illuminant in the lighthouse, the light is not stationary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
in its vertical plane; it is swung from side to side and up and
down in rhythm with the movement of the vessel. Under
these circumstances, at one moment the light would project
a short ray owing to the declination of the beam in relation
to the line of the water, thereby bringing it below the
horizon, while the next moment, when the ship lurched in
the opposite direction, the ray of light would be thrown into
the air and above the horizon. The problem is to keep the
light at one steady angle, irrespective of the motion of the
vessel, and this end is achieved by hanging each reflector
upon gimbals, so that the rolling practically is counteracted,
the reflectors maintaining a constant vertical position.</p>

<p>Some lights are of the flashing type, and in this instance
the reflectors are disposed in groups. Here the gimbals,
carrying the reflectors, are mounted upon the framework
which revolves around the mast by clockwork mechanism,
and are so arranged as to give any type of distinguishing
flash that may be desired. In the most approved types of
modern lightships, however, the dioptric apparatus is
incorporated, means having been discovered to avoid
breakage from the rolling motion of the ship, while the risk
of throwing the beam above or below the horizon according
to the rolling of the boat is overcome. In this case the lamps
and reflectors are disposed on a turntable in the lantern, with
the dioptric apparatus mounted very carefully so as to secure
a true balance upon gimbals. The apparatus for revolving
the light is erected in a deck-house, the weight actuating the
mechanism being permitted to rise and fall in a special tube
extending from the bottom of the ship to the deck. The
rotary action thus produced is transmitted from the deck
to the lantern above by means of a vertical shaft and pinion.
While ordinary lamps are installed as a rule in the lanterns,
Messrs. Chance Brothers and Co., the Birmingham lighthouse
illuminating engineers, have succeeded in adapting
their incandescent oil-vapour system, which has proved so
eminently successful in lighthouses, to light-vessels, with a
very decided increase in the candle-power, and marked
economy in oil consumption and cost of upkeep.</p>

<span class="subhead">A FLAMING SENTINEL OF THE MALACCA STRAITS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>With the development of commerce between Europe,
China, and Japan, following the awakening of the East,
it became imperative to render the seas approaching these
countries far safer to navigation. If one consults the atlas,
and follows the routes taken by the great liners from Britain
and the Continent to the Orient, he will see a rampart forming
the boundary between the Indian Ocean and the South
China Sea. This is the East Indian Archipelago, and it
bristles with dangers of all descriptions to the mercantile
traffic flowing to and fro. After leaving India, the steamships
turn their noses towards Singapore, at the extremity
of the Malay Peninsula; but this busy port is shut in on the
south by the attenuated rocky chain of islands forming the
Dutch East Indies, of which Sumatra and Java are the most
important.</p>

<p>The steamship lane lies between Sumatra and the Asian
mainland, and is known as the Straits of Malacca. It is a
fearsome neck of water, studded with islands and sandbanks,
some visible above high-water, others revealed only
by the falling tide; while still more never see daylight at all,
yet owing to their shallow position are none the less perilous.</p>

<p>In order to foster the growth of the sea-traffic with China,
these unattractive waters demanded full illumination,
while the rock-girt shores of China and Japan were similarly
in need of protective outposts. Japan was particularly
enterprising in this forward movement. The country was
emerging from the state of suspended civilization in which
it had reposed so calmly for centuries. The rising forces
were not slow to realize that unless they safeguarded
steamship traffic their ports would wait in vain for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
ships from Europe. In fact, the mercantile interests of the
Western world bluntly stated that unless this course were
followed their ships would not come to trade.</p>

<p>Japan at that time had not capable men at home for the
purpose of completing the first part of a comprehensive
coast-lighting scheme, and it was acknowledged that years
must elapse before the country would be able to walk alone
in this field. Accordingly they sought Britain’s assistance.
The Stevenson family, as narrated already, elaborated a
comprehensive scheme, which was accepted. The structures
were prepared in Britain, sent out piecemeal to Japan
together with a force of competent men, and erected at
the desired points.</p>

<p>Upon this foundation the Japanese built up their excellent
lighthouse service. The Eastern pupil, in his own estimation,
became as competent as the Scottish teachers. At all
events, Japan has since completed all works of this description
at home and unaided. China followed suit, but in
this instance it was due to British initiative purely and
simply. The British Inspector-General of the Imperial
Maritime Customs took up the question. He appointed an
engineer-in-chief, to whom the construction and repair of
the lights were entrusted. The chief engineer was provided
with a coast inspector, upon whom devolved the responsibility
for the personnel and the maintenance of the stations,
he in turn being assisted in his exacting and, at that time,
difficult work by a corps of zealous officers.</p>

<p>Although the countries concerned and the shipping companies
of Europe appreciated this forward policy, one class
of individuals resented this introduction of Western ideas
into Oriental life. This was the population who lived by
wrecking and piracy. They recognized the fact only too
well, that, if brilliant beacons were to be permitted to be
erected freely throughout these troublous seas, their despicable
but remunerative calling would cease. Their solution
of the problem assumed a characteristic Chinese and Malay
form; they endeavoured to wreak their revenge upon the
lights. Now and again there were sharp tussles between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
the engineering staffs and these high-water brigands, but
firearms well handled by the white men invariably got the
better of the argument. Pirates caught in the attempt to
tamper with the lights received very short shrift. One
engineer who had seen service in these waters related to me
that in the early days the amount of lead expended in protecting
a light from these marauders exceeded the quantity
of this metal used in the tower itself.</p>

<p>The Malacca Straits, from their exceedingly dangerous
nature, constituted a happy hunting-ground for these
gentlemen, and the lighting of these waters was effected as
soon as possible. Among the innumerable menaces abounding,
a shoal some sixteen miles west of the coastline was particularly
harassing to mariners. It became known as One
Fathom Bank, and the shallowest part was only about
18 feet below the surface at high-water. When these
waters were guarded first, a lightship did duty; but the
position is so open, and is so exposed to the full fury of
the monsoon, that she frequently dragged her anchors, so
that the warning became somewhat uncertain.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it was decided to supersede the floating
light by a permanent structure, and a lighthouse on stilts,
similar to those familiar to American waters, was erected
in 1874, and emitted a white flash once a minute. Although
this ironwork structure was pounded mercilessly by the
seas, it withstood all assaults completely, and was only
superseded eventually owing to the ever-increasing exigencies
of commerce, which demanded a more powerful and
elevated light.</p>

<p>The present tower was commenced in 1907. The engineers
appreciated the fact that they were being called upon to
carry out an undertaking in an especially trying position.
The bank is well out to sea, and when the monsoon is in
full blast waves 8 feet in height thunder upon the shoal,
their ferocity varying according to the state of the tide,
which rises and falls a matter of 14 feet. The difficulties
attending the building of the Rothersand and Fourteen Foot
Bank lighthouses under closely similar conditions were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
forgotten, and the prospect of building a huge caisson on
the mainland, and then towing it to the site to be sunk,
was by no means attractive, even if the fullest avail were
taken of the spells of calmest weather.</p>

<p>Therefore an alternative method of construction, possessing
the qualities of being simpler, quicker, and less expensive,
which was advanced by a well-known firm of
engineers in Singapore, Messrs. Hargreaves, Riley and Co.,
upon the designs of Mr. O.&nbsp;P. Thomas, received the closest
consideration. This scheme proposed a lighthouse constructed
on piles, with the focal plane 92½ feet above water-level,
wrought in ferro-concrete.</p>

<p>The project was somewhat novel and daring, because,
although this constructive principle had been adopted
previously for stations upon the mainland, it had never been
utilized in connection with exposed sea-lights. The system
recommended was that known as the Hennebique, which
had been employed extensively for buildings, bridges, sea-defences,
and other works. The proposal was investigated
thoroughly by the Hon. A. Murray, M.Inst.C.E., the Colonial
Engineer and Surveyor-General for the Straits Settlements,
and, as it met with his full approval, the work was handed
over to the Singapore engineers to fulfil upon the lines
advanced.</p>

<p>The structure comprises the main building, including
the living-quarters, supported upon piles disposed in two
rings, an inner and an outer, about a central pile, the whole
being well braced together. The shape is octagonal in plan.
From the roof of the living-quarters, to which point the
outer piles are carried vertically from the sea-bed, these
members rise with an inward rake, forming an octagonal
pyramid, with the lantern and its room below forming the
apex.</p>

<p>The underwater work was the most difficult, owing to
the situation and the climatic conditions. Seeing that the
nearest land is sixteen miles distant, it was impossible to
carry the men to and from the scene of their labours every
day when the weather permitted. A base was established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
on the coast for the preparation of materials and as a point
for shipping all requirements to the site, but the men were
accommodated with special facilities upon the spot. Here
a temporary staging was built on piles, on which platform
a large hut was erected to provide quarters for the men, as
well as a workshop.</p>

<p>The piles forming the main support to the building were
made 50½ feet long, and hollow. The concrete, composed
of broken granite and Portland cement, encased a steel
skeleton, consisting of four longitudinal round steel rods,
1¾ inches in diameter, laid at the corners, and laced together
with steel wire <span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch thick. Eight of these piles were
made 18 inches square, while nine were 24 inches square,
and each was fitted with a pointed end to facilitate driving
into the sea-bed.</p>

<p>As these piles were prepared on shore, their transference
to the site was a pretty problem in itself. Ordinary methods
of transport were impracticable. The engineer overcame
the difficulty in an ingenious manner. He built up a raft
of barrels, twenty-six of which were lashed together in
two rows, between which the pile was laid flat and evenly.
The raft was built upon peculiar lines, so as to facilitate the
unshipping of the pile when it reached its destination. It
was divided into four sections, each of which could be
detached without disturbing the other three parts. The
raft and its pile were towed out to sea by a steamer, and
when the work was gained the raft was cast off, to be floated
under the staging and to the exact point where it was to be
set up. A chain sling was lowered from the platform and
attached to the head of the pile, and the lashings to the
first section of the raft were released, thus permitting the
strapped barrels concerned to float away and to be recovered.
The pile was then slowly and carefully hoisted at the head,
the second part of the raft being released when the pile had
gained a certain height. This procedure was repeated until
finally, when the last part of the raft was freed, the pile
hung free, as vertically true as a plumb-line, with the pointed
foot resting on the sand. In order to send it truly into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
sea-bed, heavy timber guides were set up, and as the pile
descended it was frequently tested with the plummet, to
see that it was sinking in an absolutely perpendicular
manner.</p>

<div id="ip_262" class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>COMPLETING THE ONE FATHOM BANK LIGHTHOUSE IN THE MALACCA STRAITS.</p>

<p class="captionc">The keepers live on the lower floors. The upper floor beneath the lantern is the service room.</p></div></div>

<p>The piles were sunk into the soft sea-bed by means of
water-jets, which, playing about the foot of the pile,
burrowed a hole into which it could move downwards. A
depth of 15 feet had been considered necessary to secure
the desired rigidity, and as a rule the pile could be driven
to this depth in about four hours. When the pile-driving
commenced, however, it was found that the sandbank had
undergone a marked change since the surveys were made.
Erosion had been very active owing to the currents having
been checked by the obstructions which the legs of the
staging offered. Under these circumstances a novel experiment
was made upon the site. One of the piles was lengthened
by 14½ feet, to be driven to its limits, just to ascertain
how far it would go into the sand. This in itself was a
somewhat daring undertaking, seeing that the tiny colony
on the staging did not possess the facilities which were
available on shore for the work. However, it was accomplished
satisfactorily, and when the pile was sunk it was
found to descend another 13½ feet, where it touched hard
rock. This discovery brought about a modification in the
plans. As a solid foundation could be gained at a depth
of 28½ feet, and as the piles could be lengthened successfully
upon the site, it was decided to extend all the piles to a
complete length of 64½ feet, and to drive them down to the
hard bottom. When the piles were all lowered, they were
subjected to four blows from a “monkey” weighing
2½ tons, dropped from a height of 4 feet. But these four
final blows only drove the piles from ¼ to <span class="fraction"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch farther
into the sea-bed, whereas, according to the specification,
a margin of 1 inch was allowed for this test.</p>

<p>The diameter of the tower at the base is 40 feet, and heavy
bracing is introduced at a point 4 feet below high-water to
hold the fabric together, and to supply the requisite strength
and rigidity. At a height of 21 feet above this main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
bracing is the floor of the superstructure, comprising an
octagonal two-floor building, surrounded by an overhanging
gallery, built on the cantilever principle, 5 feet in width,
which forms the landing platform. The two floors have a
total height of 24 feet, and constitute the keepers’ home.
The roof is flat, in order to facilitate the collection and
conduct of rain-water into two ferro-concrete cisterns, each
holding 1,000 gallons. The lower floor is devoted to housing
stores, oil, etc., while the upper story forms the living-quarters.
The roof is caused to overhang a distance of
4 feet on all sides, thereby providing a flat surface 44 feet
across. From this point the eight main columns of the
building slope inwards, until, at a height of 30 feet, they
have a diameter of 18½ feet, where the lantern is introduced.
The lower part of the latter constitutes the service-room,
and leads directly to the lantern above. Access to the
different levels is afforded by means of a teak-wood staircase,
while that leading from the entrance floor to the water
for landing purposes is hinged, so that it may be accommodated
to the condition of the tide.</p>

<p>The lantern, which weighs 17½ tons, is of the modern
type, and is more powerful than that of the 1874 light, which
it displaced. The white light is thrown in groups of flashes
every fifteen seconds, and the warning is visible from the
deck of a vessel some fifteen miles away. The central pier,
which carries a great proportion of the total weight of the
tower, and which extends continuously from the bed-rock
foundation to the lantern-room, is solid to the roof of the
living-quarters. Above this point it is hollow, having a
bore of 12 inches, and in this space the weight actuating
the revolving mechanism of the light moves up and
down.</p>

<p class="captionc">It is built throughout of ferro-concrete, and is supported on piles driven into the sand. At the left are the quarters provided for the lighthouse
builders who lived on the spot.</p></div></div>

<p>Although the idea was novel at the time, the complete
success of the work justified the recommendations of the
designers as to the suitability of this form of construction
for open-sea lighthouses. In this instance the enterprise
not only was completed for a less sum than would have been
required for a corresponding lighthouse erected in masonry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
upon orthodox lines, but the structure is lighter, was more
rapidly built, and is thoroughly hygienic. The complete
weight of the whole tower is less than 1,000 tons; and from
the setting of the first pile to the lighting of the lamps only
fourteen months elapsed, notwithstanding the fact that
work was interrupted and hindered frequently by inclement
weather. Any doubts that were entertained concerning
the ability of the structure to resist the attacks of the wind
and seas encountered in these latitudes was dispelled during
erection, because the monsoons which broke during the
period of erection were abnormally heavy, and submitted
the fabric to exceptional strains and stresses, which it withstood
with complete success.</p>

<p>Another fine light which has been provided for the benefit
of the navigator in these Eastern seas is that on Gap Rock.
This is a rugged, lofty eminence, rising from the sea, thirty-two
miles south of Hong-Kong. Being exposed on all sides,
it is difficult to approach, while at the same time it lies in the
path of vessels. A few years ago the Hong-Kong Government
decided to conquer this islet, and to deprive it of its
perils to shipping. With great effort a landing was effected,
and one of the pinnacles was decapitated and levelled off,
to form a spacious platform for landing. The light itself
rises from the highest point of the rock, and its rays are
visible through a circle of twenty miles radius. The Gap
Rock light is also a signal-station, being in telegraphic
communication with Hong-Kong.</p>

<p>Although the days of human hostility to the lighthouse
in Eastern waters have passed, the engineer is confronted
by an enemy which is in every way as destructive. This
is the white ant. The ravages of this insect are so relentless
and complete where wood is concerned that timber towers
are quite impracticable. Moreover, this material has to be
used only sparingly for fittings, even in masonry and iron
buildings.</p>

<p>A curious experience with this insidious and implacable
foe was related to me by a lighthouse engineer. He was
engaged in the erection of a new beacon at a remote point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
on the coast. The lenses and lantern apparatus, as usual,
had been ordered in England, and were despatched to the
East carefully packed in substantial tin-lined cases. In
order to secure the utmost protection during transit, each
metallic and lenticular part was wrapped in tow. Care
also was bestowed upon the sealing of the tin case, since
the propensity of the ant to discover the smallest pinhole
so as to reach the interior was emphasized upon
the packers. Accordingly the seams were doubly soldered.</p>

<p>In due course the cases with their precious contents
reached the site of erection, but unfortunately the season
was so far advanced that the engineer concluded he could
not complete the erection of the lantern before the monsoon
broke. As the contents of the cases were preserved by
the tin armour from climatic attacks, he stored the cases
securely, and with his workmen left the place until favourable
weather returned.</p>

<p>Some weeks later the chief and his toilers reappeared upon
the scene. All preparations for setting the optical apparatus
were completed. Imagine the dismay of the engineer
when, on opening the case containing the most important
parts of the lantern, he found that it had been raided by
white ants. They had driven their tracks spirally through
the tow, which evidently they had enjoyed, and although
this was of little consequence, the formic acid had played
sad havoc with the bright surfaces of the spindles. In
lighthouse engineering the surfaces of these parts must be
as bright and as clean as a mirror to insure smooth, steady
working. But now these spindles were as pitted and marked
as a victim to smallpox. It was a maddening contretemps,
since the only way to restore the vital bright surfaces was
to turn them in the lathe. Such a tool was not available
within a hundred or more miles. Erection had to be delayed,
however, until this treatment was effected.</p>

<p>Seeing that the tin case was soldered up with such infinite
care, the question arises. How did the ants get into it? To
the engineer it seemed an inscrutable puzzle, but he subjected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
the case to a minute examination. Finally he solved
the problem. At one corner he found that a nail, while
being driven during the process of nailing up the heavy
outer wooden case at the English factory, had turned slightly,
so that its point had punctured the inner metal case. The
ants, too, had discovered this minute breach, and through
it had swarmed to the attack upon the interior.</p>

<span class="subhead">UNATTENDED LIGHTHOUSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>During the past fifty years engineering science as applied to
lighthouses has made remarkable advances. This has been
due largely to the indefatigable perseverance and ceaseless
labour of the chemist in regard to illumination. This
wonder-worker has given us acetylene, has evolved means
whereby oil-gas may be compressed to a pressure of several
atmospheres with safety, and has discovered other gases
obtainable by inexpensive and simple means. The engineer
has not hesitated to profit from these developments, and
has devised highly ingenious apparatuses whereby these
illuminating mediums may be stored and used, so as to dispense
with the human element almost entirely; in fact, in
these instances the latter factor has been reduced to such a
degree that it is only called upon to perform certain perfunctory
operations, such as the recharging of the storage
vessels at long intervals&mdash;three, six, or twelve months,
according to circumstances.</p>

<p>This combination has provided the lighthouse engineer
with a new, powerful, and efficient means of overcoming
abnormal difficulties. Many a rock, reef, or stretch of uninhabited
coastline has demanded indication, but has defied
such protection from motives of cost, inaccessibility, or
searching problems concerning the accommodation and
relief of the keepers. As I have shown in the course of this
volume, the erection of a first-class lighthouse is a costly
undertaking, and the shipping interests, which in the case
of Great Britain and a few other countries are called upon
to pay the bill, naturally demur, unless the rock or other
obstacle is situate in the centre of the marine thoroughfare,
or the approach to a pitiless coast is extremely hazardous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
when the erection of the tower becomes absolutely imperative.
If one were to add up the costs of all the great lights
scattered throughout the seven seas, it would be found that
several millions sterling had been sunk in this humane
effort, and yet, relatively speaking, but a small area of
danger in the aggregate is safeguarded.</p>

<div id="ip_268" class="figcenter" style="width: 601px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>THE PLATTE FOUGÈRE LIGHTHOUSE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.</p>

<p class="captionc">This automatic light marks a dangerous reef, off the Guernsey coast, which is familiar to readers of Victor Hugo’s “Toilers of the Sea.”</p></div></div>

<p>Then the human factor demands consideration. A colony
of four or six men scarcely could be found willing to suffer
isolation from the world at large and to be deprived of
intercourse with their fellow-beings in the interests of
shipping, say, through the Straits of Magellan, around Cape
Horn, among the icy fastnesses of the Northern Labrador
coast, or in Hudson Bay. Life in the lighthouses which
guard the busy steamship lanes is monotonous and nerve-shattering
enough, but to maroon men in such remote
places as those mentioned above would be to promote a
wholesale rush of inmates for the lunatic asylums.</p>

<p>This is where the chemist and the engineer in collaboration
have triumphed. By their joint efforts it is now possible
to supply the most inhospitable shore with a belt of lights
equal in every respect to those mounting sentinel over the
more densely populated reaches of coast in the civilized
parts of the globe. The unattended lighthouse is a modern
development born of necessity, which has proved highly
serviceable, effective, and reliable. The passenger, as he
lolls against the taffrail of the steamer ploughing her way
carefully through the lane 375 miles long separating the
mainland of South America from Tierra del Fuego, and
watches the faithful star twinkling upon the top of a frowning
cliff and urging the mariner to keep clear, may cherish
a feeling of pity for the man who has to keep that beam
shining. But his commiseration is misplaced. No human
hands touch that beacon, perhaps, for six months or more at
a time. It is a triumph of automatic operation. The same
applies to the wicked shores of New Zealand, the uninviting
northern stretches of the Gulf of Bothnia, the iron-bound
coasts of Norway and Sweden, and many another unattractive
mainland and island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
All the great maritime nations possess several of these
silent, faithful lights, which, although upon their introduction
they were regarded with a certain amount of suspicion,
owing to the urgent necessity of a light never failing in
its duty for the guidance of the seafarer, yet have been proved
by the convincing lesson of experience to be as reliable in
every respect as the light which is tended by human hands.</p>

<p>So far as Great Britain is concerned, the unattended light
has been brought to a high stage of efficiency and utility by
the efforts of Messrs. David and Charles Stevenson, while
in other parts of the world the apparatus and methods

<p>The most interesting example of the Stevenson unattended
lighthouse is provided in the English Channel, indicating the
entrance to the strait which leads to the Guernsey capital of
St. Peter Port. This was one of the first of its character to
be erected, but the type is now being adopted widely owing
to the success of this initial undertaking. The Channel
Islands have achieved an unsavoury reputation in marine
annals, as they form a graveyard of the Channel; they have
claimed their victims, during recent years at any rate,
mostly from the ranks of the heavy cross-Channel traffic.</p>

<p>The Russell Channel, leading to St. Peter Port from the
north, is exceedingly dangerous, the sea being littered with
granite rocks both submerged and exposed, of which the
Grande Braye, Barsier, and Platte Fougère, form the outer
rampart. Readers of Victor Hugo may gather some realistic
idea of the perilous nature of these waters by perusing “The
Toilers of the Sea,” in which these rocks figure very
prominently, particularly the Platte Fougère. The menace
of this corner of the channel is accentuated by the velocity
of the tidal currents which swing and swirl round the reefs,
together with the extreme range of the tides, which averages
about 30 feet. Formerly, in thick weather, vessels found
it almost impossible to pick up the Russell, and often a
captain, by the rip and crash of metal being torn, to his
dismay learned that he had swung too far to the westward.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>SETTING THE COMPRESSED-AIR RESERVOIR AT FORT DOYLE.</p>

<p class="captionc">The Platte Fougère automatic light is supplemented by a land station on the island of Guernsey
a mile away.</p></div></div>

<p>The companies engaged in this traffic repeatedly petitioned
the authorities to mark the entrance to the strait by some
adequate means. A light was not required so keenly as a
sound-signal, because in clear weather navigation was
tolerably safe. The proposal was discussed time after time,
but no solution appeared to be forthcoming. To erect a
lighthouse on the outer fringe of the barrier would have
entailed prodigious expenditure, which the island authorities
could ill afford, even if such a scheme were practicable.</p>

<p>The question was taken up boldly by General Campbell
during his occupation of the post of Governor-General of the
Island of Guernsey, and he pressed forward the scheme
vigorously in a resolute determination to bring about a
diminution in the number of maritime disasters at this
point. He approached Messrs. David and Charles Stevenson,
who had considerable experience of similar conditions around
the Scottish coasts, and they, after an elaborate survey of
the site, recommended the erection of a light and fog-signal
station upon the Platte Fougère, which should be controlled
from the land a mile distant. They agreed that the erection
of a tower similar to those generally planted on sea-rocks
would be a formidable undertaking and enormously expensive,
owing to the conditions prevailing, but the station
they suggested was quite practicable, and would serve the
purposes equally well.</p>

<p>Instead of a massive, gracefully-curving tower, measuring
some 40 feet in diameter at the base, these engineers suggested
a building of irregular octagonal shape, measuring
14½ and 17 feet across the faces, 80 feet in height, and
carried out in ferro-concrete. They advocated its erection
upon the Platte Fougère, because there the fog-signal
would be brought into the most serviceable position for
shipping. A narrow or thin building was advised, to offer
the minimum of surface to the waves, which break very
heavily on these ridges. The wisdom of this design has been
revealed very convincingly since the tower has been in
service. The seas fall on either side, divide and rush round
the building, so that it does not experience the full brunt of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
their heavy, smashing blows. As the engineers pointed out,
“It is better to avoid heavy sea pressures, where feasible,
in preference to courting them.”</p>

<p>Still, the Platte Fougère was not an ideal rock from the
engineers’ point of view, although it is a solid knot of granite.
Its head is visible only at low-water spring-tides, while it is
difficult to approach, even in the smoothest weather, owing
to the tides and currents. Much of the foundation work had
to be carried out under water. The season was unavoidably
limited, as the days when both the wind and the sea are
calm in this part of the channel are very few and far between.</p>

<p>The tower is solid for a height of 46 feet above the rock,
and the base is formed of Portland cement placed in iron
moulds, with iron bars driven into the solid rock to anchor
the concrete firmly. On the side to which the building is
exposed to the heaviest seas, massive beams of rolled steel
are driven into the rock, so as to impart additional strength
to the part of the tower where the greatest strains are likely
to be set up.</p>

<p>On the entrance level is a compartment containing an
electric motor and air-compressor, while on the floor immediately
above is a duplicate installation. The siren
projects through the top of the tower, the trumpet being so
turned as to throw the sounds in a horizontal direction
over the water. On the top of the tower is a small automatic
acetylene gas plant and light, such as the engineers have
employed so successfully in their unattended Scottish light-stations,
two air-receivers, and a water-tank. A new type
of burner is used, and a clockwork mechanism is incorporated
to extinguish the light at dawn and to ignite it at dusk, with
a special arrangement to allow for the short summer nights
and the long periods of darkness during the winter.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the station is controlled electrically
from a point on shore. In deciding the latter, it was necessary
to discover the most favourable landing-place for the
submarine cable in relation to its route, and Doyle Fort
was selected as meeting all requirements in this direction.
Here a two-floor dwelling has been erected for the keepers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
together with an adjoining engine-house, which measures
32 feet in length by 20 feet wide. The tower being a mile
distant, the designers had to meet the possibility of the
machinery therein breaking down. Accordingly, at the
shore station there is an auxiliary fog-siren and air-compressing
plant, which is brought into use when the sea
apparatus is deranged.</p>

THE SCOTTISH COAST.</p>

<p class="captionl">These lights will run for several months without any human attention, and, by means of ingenious
mechanism, light and extinguish themselves automatically.</p></div></div>

<p>The machinery includes two oil-engines which drive three-phase
alternators, and an air-compressor for working the
land siren when required. One of the greatest difficulties
arose in connection with the submarine cable which connects
the land-station with the sea-tower. Owing to the broken,
rocky nature of the sea-bed, the viciousness of the currents,
and the heavy seas, the cable had to be of exceptional
strength; indeed, it had to be made specially for the purpose.
It is a double-sheathed, steel-armoured cable of the heaviest
“rock” type, being 11 inches in circumference, and weighing
45 tons per nautical mile. As the current used is three-phase,
there are three conductors, which weigh 1,100 pounds
per mile, protected by a thick layer of gutta-percha averaging
450 pounds per mile. In the centre of the core are two
other wires for switching and telephone purposes respectively.
The laying of the cable was a peculiar and exacting task in
itself; 6,504 feet had to be paid out. But by waiting for a
very calm day and slack water this task was achieved
without mishap. In the tower there is a simple switch
operated by an electro-magnet, whereby the motor-driven
air-compressors are thrown in and out of action. The two
compressors are used alternately, so as to keep them in
thorough working order; and as they have to be left sometimes
for months without being examined, special attention
has been devoted to their lubrication.</p>

<p>A visit to this lighthouse is a somewhat curious experience.
Climbing the ladder and entering the building, one finds it
apparently abandoned. Not a sound beyond the murmuring
of the waves playing about the rocks below disturbs a silence
which is uncannily tense. Suddenly there is an almost
imperceptible click. The keeper at the light-station has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
moved his switch, and simultaneously that in the tower has
closed. The electric motors instantly commence to revolve,
with a low grunt at first, but rising quickly to a loud humming
as they settle down to their stride, driving the air-compressors.
Then comes the ear-splitting, deep-toned roar
from the siren overhead, attended by the whirr of machinery
in motion. The humming of the motors and the compressors
dies down, and in a few seconds absolute stillness
prevails once more. The sensation is decidedly eerie. It
seems impossible that a silence so intense as to be felt should
be interrupted by a click&mdash;the result of a slight movement
by an unseen hand a mile away&mdash;which gives forth such a
nerve-shattering din as to convey the idea that Bedlam had
been let loose. At the land-station the experience is similarly
weird. The keeper moves his switch which brings the
tower machinery into action. Presently there is the sharp
tinkle of an electric bell. This notifies the keeper that the
blast on the tower has been given, but conclusive evidence
of this fact does not arrive until five seconds later, when
the baying of the siren comes rolling over the water.</p>

<p>A complete check is kept upon the isolated station out at
sea. If the electric bell does not ring out at the appointed
period, to notify the keeper that the siren has emitted its
warning note, he knows that something is amiss. The land-station
is brought into service without delay, the intimation
to the mariner to stand clear being thrown from Doyle Fort
once every ninety seconds. The men on shore take it in
turns to mount watch for fog both day and night, and their
vigil is checked. There is an electric alarm, which maintains
silence only so long as the man on duty fulfils his appointed
task and records this fact upon his mechanical register at
scheduled intervals. Should he fail to perform this function,
there is a frenzied clanging by the alarm-bell, which summons
the second keeper to duty.</p>

<p>Apparently, the weakest point in the installation is the
submarine cable, but the engineers entertain no apprehensions
on this score. It is too stoutly made and too
heavily armoured to rupture very readily. Experience has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
proved its efficiency and reliability, while a long life is anticipated
for it. The Platte Fougère unattended lighthouse has
opened up new possibilities for protecting wild coasts. It
has proved conclusively that there is no difficulty in maintaining
such a station and controlling it from a distance so
long as automatic apparatus which has proved its worth
is employed. This practical application should serve to
solve many peculiar problems. No longer can the bogie of
expense be put forward as an argument against safeguarding
a notoriously evil length of shoreline or isolated rock, even
if the latter is exposed to the heaviest seas known. The
Guernsey installation was completed for £8,500, or $42,500,
and is as serviceable as the ordinary type of tower, which in
this instance would have cost at least £60,000, or $300,000,
to build and equip. From the maintenance point of view
it is equally convincing and economical, inasmuch as only two
keepers are required in the place of the four who otherwise
would have been necessary.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE DALÉN “SUN-VALVE,” THE MOST WONDERFUL
INVENTION OF MODERN LIGHTHOUSE ENGINEERING.</p>

<p class="captionl">Depending upon the action of daylight alone, it automatically ignites and extinguishes
the light at dusk and dawn respectively.</p></div></div>

<p>The system which has been devised by Mr. Gustaf Dalén
of Stockholm, and which is exploited by the Gas Accumulator
Company of the Swedish capital, operates with dissolved
acetylene. The first light in Scandinavian waters to be
brought into action upon the “Aga” principle, as it is
called, was installed in the Gasfeten tower, an exceedingly
isolated beacon which offered every means of testing it
thoroughly. The idea follows the broad lines of that
adopted in connection with lightships, and, the Gasfeten
experiments proving completely successful, it has been
adopted extensively since, not only by the Swedish authorities
for the lighting of lonely waters in the Baltic Sea and
Gulf of Bothnia, but by various other Powers. The Straits
of Magellan are protected in this way, and when one recalls
the sparse population which dwells upon the banks of this
short-cut between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and
bears in mind the fact that the lights have to be left to their
own automatic action for some months on end, then one
may realize the perfection and reliability of the invention.
The failure of a light in such treacherous waters would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
notified speedily to the authorities responsible for the
illumination of this sea-lane, but no such complaints appear
to have been received from passing vessels. These lonely
lights for the most part are of a very simple character, a
result due to local conditions. As a rule they are planted on
lofty eminences&mdash;not at too high an elevation, as thereby
they might be rendered useless by headland fogs&mdash;at a
height varying between 150 and 250 feet. The base of the
tower forms a space for the accommodation of the gas-accumulators,
wherein the illuminating medium is stored
under pressure, surmounted by the lantern which carries
the requisite optical apparatus, and the flasher whereby
the characteristic visual warning is given.</p>

<p>Although adoption of the flasher enabled the consumption
of gas to be reduced very appreciably, there was one noticeable
drawback: the light had to burn both night and day,
unless clockwork mechanism were introduced to extinguish
the light at sunrise and to ignite it at twilight. Some
authorities, however, do not place trust in clockwork
mechanism. Certainly it is liable to fail at a critical moment,
and in the case of an isolated light, several hundred miles
from the nearest base, this would be a serious calamity,
intimation of the fact not being available until several weeks
after the disability had been observed.</p>

<p>In order to overcome the fallibility of clockwork, and to
insure a still further marked decrease in the consumption
of gas, Mr. Gustaf Dalén devoted his energies to the perfection
of a device which should achieve the self-same end,
but be operated by Nature herself. His efforts were crowned
with complete success by the invention of the “light-valve,”
but which has become more widely known as the “sun-valve.”</p>

<div id="ip_275" class="figcenter" style="width: 558px;">
  <img src="images/i_p274b.jpg" width="558" height="345" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>THE GAS ACCUMULATORS EMPLOYED IN THE DALÉN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM.</p>

<p class="captionc">The size of the storage cylinder varies according to the work, character, and position of the beacon.</p></div></div>

<p>This device is based upon a well-known principle. If
two objects, fashioned from the same metal, and identical
in every respect except that one is made light-absorbing
and the other light-reflecting, are exposed to daylight, while
the former will expand, the latter will remain unaffected.
This result is due to the fact that the one which absorbs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
light transforms it into energy. The acting part of the
“sun-valve” therefore is a light-absorber. It consists of a
central rod, the surface of which is coated with lampblack,
so that its light-absorbing qualities are enhanced as much
as possible. The lower part of this rod is connected to a
small lever, which opens and shuts an orifice through which
the gas passes to the flasher in the lantern above. Around
this central black copper rod are three other copper rods,
disposed equidistantly. They resemble the former in every
respect except that they have no light-absorbing qualities,
but they are given polished gold surfaces, so that their
light-reflecting properties are raised to the maximum.</p>

<p>This sun-valve is exposed. At the break of dawn, under
the gathering intensity of daylight, the central black rod
absorbs the luminosity, the amount of which is increased
by the light thrown from the gold-burnished outer rods,
and, converting it into energy, expands longitudinally. In
so doing it forces the lever at the base downwards, closing
the opening through which the gas flows to the flasher.
In a short while, when the day has broken fairly and there
is no further need for the beacon’s services, the gas-feed is
cut off entirely, only the pilot burner remaining alight, the
gas-supply to this not being affected by the sun-valve. In
order to bring the greatest possible pressure upon the lever,
the blackened rod is so arranged that it can expand only in
one direction&mdash;namely, downwards.</p>

<p>Upon the approach of evening, owing to the daylight
becoming weaker, the blackened rod contracts, and, the
pressure upon the lever being released, the gas commences
to flow once more to the burner. It is a small stream at
first, but as the darkness gathers, and the shrinking continues,
the valve opens wider and wider, until at last, when
night has settled down and the copper central rod has fully
contracted, the gas-valve is opened to its fullest extent,
permitting the greatest pressure of gas to flow to the burner,
so that the beacon throws its most brilliant light. This automatic
action continues infallibly every dawn and dusk, and
is the simplest and at the same time most reliable means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
of economizing gas during the day that has yet been devised.</p>

<p>There is another feature of this system which must not be
overlooked. Suppose, for some reason or other, that the
sea becomes shrouded in suffused light, such as might arise
from the obscuring of the sun by an overhanging bank of
fog or smoke, the beacon comes automatically into service,
as the cutting off of the daylight must bring about a contraction
of the blackened copper rod controlling the valve.</p>

<p>The central rod can be adjusted to any degree of sensitiveness,
by means of a screw, while protection of the vital
parts is insured by enclosure within a heavy glass cylinder.
The first apparatus of this character was tested by the
Swedish authorities in 1907, and proved so successful that
it is now in service at all the exposed unattended lighthouses
in Swedish and Finnish waters; while it has been
adopted, also, very extensively by the United States, more
particularly for the lighting of the lonely stretches of the
Alaskan coastline and of the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>Of course, the saving of gas which is rendered possible by
the use of the sun-valve varies according to the season of
the year. During the winter, when the nights are long, the
saving may not be very marked, but in the summer, when
darkness does not last more than four or five hours, the
economy is very noticeable. According to the experience
of the Swedish authorities, the average saving of gas during
the year varies from 35 to 40 per cent., as compared with
similar lights not fitted with this device.</p>

<p>But there is another factor which is influenced to a very
appreciable degree by the utilization of the sun-valve. By
cutting off the light when it is not required, the capacity of&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the duration of service upon&mdash;one charge is lengthened,
and this in the case of an isolated light is a very
important consideration. In fact, with the “Aga” system
wherein the sun-valve is combined with the flasher, it is
possible for the light to work a round twelve months without
the least control or necessity for intermediate inspection,
and at as low an annual charge as £2 15s., or about $14.</p>

<p class="captionc">It marks a lonely dangerous rock in the Baltic Sea, and operates upon the Aga unattended
automatic system, with Dalén flasher and “sun-valve.”</p></div></div>

<p>One of the latest unattended installations which have
been carried out upon these lines is the Lagerholmen lighthouse,
marking a dangerous rock in the Baltic Sea. It is a
cylindrical tower, with the focal plane 56 feet 4 inches
above sea-level, and the flashing light, with sun-valve control,
has a range of eighteen miles. The geographical range,
however, is only thirteen miles, owing to the comparatively
low height of the tower.</p>

<p>An interesting and ingenious automatic unattended light
has also been established in an isolated part of the Bristol
Channel. It was designed by Sir Thomas Matthews, the
engineer to the Brethren of Trinity House. This is purely
and simply a clockwork-controlled apparatus in which
extreme care has been taken to eliminate the disadvantages
incidental to such mechanism. This type of light was
designed to fulfil three conditions&mdash;to give a flashing light;
to light up and go out at the proper times; and to require
attention only at long intervals. Acetylene is the illuminant
used, the gas being stored in a reservoir under high pressure.
The gas as it emerges from the supply cylinder is expanded,
so that the pressure at the burner does not exceed 2 pounds
per square inch.</p>

<p>The outstanding feature of this apparatus is that the
clockwork control cutting off and turning on the gas does
not require to be wound by hand, but is actuated by the
mechanism which revolves the lenses, through a simple set
of gearing. The gas as it issues from the reservoir passes
into one of two cylinders. Each of these is provided with an
inlet and an exhaust valve, while the upper end is closed
with a lid of leather, covering the top like the vellum of a
drum. To each leather cover is attached a circular piece of
metal, smaller than the leather diaphragm, and from this
in turn extends a vertical rod, the upper end of which is
connected to one end of a centrally pivoted rocking arm.
When the gas enters one cylinder, naturally in expanding
it forces the leather lid upwards, and with it the vertical
rod. This elevates the corresponding end of the rocking
arm, and simultaneously drives down the rod attached to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
the opposite end of the beam, which in turn drives down
the leather lid of the second cylinder, and forces out any gas
that may be therein. The apparatus consequently is something
like a double pump, owing to the rocking arm having
a seesaw motion. This reciprocating action serves to wind
up the clock, and also to revolve the lenses through spurs
and pinions. The mechanism, however, is controlled completely
by the clock whereby the light is started, inasmuch
as without this the apparatus cannot be set in motion.
There are two dials, one of which is divided into twenty-four
divisions, corresponding to the hours of the day, and the
other into twelve divisions, representing the twelve months
of the year. The clocks work together, and the time of
lighting up is advanced or retarded, according to the time
of the year, through the clock train wheels.</p>

<p>The apparatus is very compact, highly ingenious, and
has proved efficient in service. Although this is the first
application of the idea for rotating the lenses by the gas
which feeds the burners, so far as England is concerned, it
has been employed under similar circumstances in Germany
with conspicuous success, in combination with the Pintsch
oil-gas apparatuses, but it lacks the simplicity and reliability
of the sun-valve.</p>

<p>A different system, which has been adopted widely
throughout the East and in Australian waters, is the
Wigham petroleum beacon. This system possesses many
notable features, the most important being that well-refined
petroleum oil is employed. In many parts of the
world carbide of calcium is not readily obtainable, and,
moreover, is somewhat expensive, whereas, on the other
hand, oil is comparatively cheap and available in unlimited
quantities. The principle of working is somewhat
novel. The wick is not burned in the manner generally
followed in regard to lamps&mdash;viz., at the end, which within
a short time becomes carbonized and brings a marked
diminution of the illuminating power&mdash;but it is moved so
that the same part is not exposed continuously to the action
of the heat arising from combustion. It is caused to travel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
horizontally over a small roller, in a specially-constructed
burner, combustion taking place, therefore, on its flat side.
It is moved slowly and continuously over this roller, so
that it cannot burn through, and in this manner the flame,
being constantly emitted from a fresh surface, is of uniform
intensity.</p>

<p class="captionc">The type at left shows the lamp carried upon a cast-iron pillar; while on the right it is mounted

<p>The lamp comprises three main parts. There is the
lantern, with the lens and the projecting panes of plate-glass,
in the focus of which the burner is fixed. Then there
is the burning-oil reservoir, which feeds the wick as it
moves towards the burner. This reservoir is circular in
shape, somewhat shallow, and serves as a deck on which
the lantern is built up. The third part is the float cylinder,
made of copper, which is attached to the underside of the
oil reservoir. This cylinder is filled with oil, which is kept
quite distinct from the burning oil, and thereon floats a
weighted copper drum, to which one end of the wick is
secured by means of a hook. At the lower end of this
cylinder is a micrometer valve, which when opened permits
the oil to drip away at a certain speed. This causes the
float to fall with the oil in the cylinder, and to drag the
wick over the burner roller and down the float cylinder
after it, so that a fresh surface of the wick is presented
continuously for combustion. The lamps themselves may
be divided into two broad classes&mdash;the single-wick and the
three-wick respectively. The latter obviously emits the
more brilliant light, and is the type which is coming into
more extensive use at the present time. In the latest type
a duplex burner is employed, and this has been found to
give a very powerful light with a comparatively low oil
consumption.</p>

<p>The light is generally carried at the top of a lattice-work
steel tower. A support of this character can be
taken to pieces, packed within small compass, and transported
without difficulty, while erection is simplified and
facilitated. Seeing that a large number of these beacons
have been erected on headlands along the wildest stretches
of the African continent and the loneliest coasts of Australia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
where the methods of transport are restricted to coolies
or mules, this method of packing is distinctly advantageous.
The lamp is secured to the top of the tower, with the float
cylinder of the lamp depending from the centre. In this
arrangement, as a rule, a small tank is provided into which
a drain-pipe empties the oil dropping from the drip-valve.
In this way the oil may be drawn off, filtered, and used
again in the float cylinder. In some instances the lamp
is mounted upon a cast-iron column, in which case the
float cylinder and the oil-drip tank are placed within the
tube, access thereto being obtained through a door.</p>

<p>The length of service on one charge varies according to
the situation of the light. If in a very exposed and inaccessible
place, it may be required to burn for two or
three months without attention. Taken on the average,
however, a monthly charge has been found to offer the
greatest advantages. But in some places the longer interval
is unavoidable. For instance, the Wigham light which
is mounted upon the extremity of the Manora breakwater
at Karachi cannot be approached for three months at a
time during the monsoon. Under these circumstances a
one-hundred-day service is imperative.</p>

<p>The lenses are of the dioptric order, consisting of six
elements built up into a strong gun-metal framework.
The internal diameter naturally varies with the size and
number of the wicks, and ranges from 10 inches for a
1<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch single wick, to 15 inches in the case of a 1<span class="fraction"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch
three-wick lamp. In the larger sizes a curved plate-glass
pane is fitted outside the lens as a protection from the action
of the weather. These storm-panes are set in copper doors,
so that the glasses may be easily cleaned and polished when
the lamp is being retrimmed.</p>

<p>The maintenance charges are guided by the local market
values of materials and labour, the item of repairs and
renewals being practically negligible. So far as oil consumption
per month is concerned, this fluctuates according
to the type of lamp used, ranging from 1<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub></span> pints per twenty-four
hours, or 4·8 gallons per month, in the case of a 1<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
single-wick burner, to 2¼ pints per twenty-four hours, or
8¾ gallons of oil per month, in the case of the latest 1<span class="fraction"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch
duplex-wick burner. American petroleum-oil, of a specific
gravity of about 0·795, gives the best results and the
brightest and clearest flame. Russian and other heavier
oils generally used in lighthouses are unsuitable. In view
of the world-wide operations of the Standard Oil Company,
however, no difficulty is experienced in procuring adequate
supplies of this oil anywhere between the two Poles.</p>

<p>The oil used in the float cylinder, as mentioned previously,
is quite distinct from the burning oil, and is used
only to support the float to which the wick is attached.
As the oil escapes through the drip-valve, it may be allowed
to run to waste, or, what is far preferable, it may be caught,
filtered, and used again for this purpose, to bring about a
reduction in the cost of upkeep. The float cylinder of a
thirty-one-day light, irrespective of the number of wicks,
requires the same quantity of oil for the float cylinder&mdash;9½
gallons.</p>

<p>The advantages of the unattended, automatic light have
been appreciated by the various maritime Powers, and
their application is being developed rapidly. They are
inexpensive in first cost, and their maintenance charges are
very low. In Sweden a second-order light, consuming
6 cubic feet of acetylene gas per hour, throwing a fixed
white light of 4,000 candle-power, and visible for seventeen
miles in clear weather, costs about £15, or $75, per annum;
while the smaller lights, with a 300-millimetre lens and a
12-inch burner emitting 360 candle-power, may be run
for £2, or $10, per annum, the low cost in this instance
being attributable to use of the Dalén flasher and sun-valve.</p>

<p>The cost of the acetylene gas averages ¾d., or 1½ cents,
per cubic foot, a result attributable to the fact that Scandinavia
is the world’s largest producer of carbide of calcium.</p>

<p>The Wigham petroleum system has proved similarly
economical and reliable, and has been installed in some
of the wildest corners of the globe. The Congested Districts
Board for Ireland have established a number of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
beacons on the rugged west coast to assist the fishermen
in making their harbours at night. Many are placed in
very exposed positions on headlands, where they are frequently
swept by the full force of the Atlantic gales. The
Austrian Government has adopted the principle for lighting
the dangerous coasts of the Adriatic near Trieste, while
the shoreline of Jamaica is safeguarded by more than
sixteen lights of this type. Many of these lights suffered
severely from the effects of the earthquake which overwhelmed
the island a few years ago, but others withstood
all the shocks successfully. In this instance, had expensive
and massive lighthouses of the usual type been erected,
the loss would have been considerable, in view of the severity
of this seismic disturbance and the widespread destruction
which was wrought. These lights play a very prominent
part in the guarding of the southern ocean, the Australian
shores being protected by over sixty such beacons, many
of which are established in very exposed and isolated
positions off the mainland.</p>

<p>While the day is still far distant when expensive graceful
towers, carrying immensely powerful lights, will be no longer
constructed, the perfection and utility of the unattended
light, in one or other of its many forms, are assisting tangibly
in the solution of the problem of lighting busy shorelines
adequately and inexpensively. Structures costing tens of
thousands sterling in future will be restricted to important
places, especially in connection with sea-rocks, such as
landfalls, or to those some distance from the land, where
a fog-signal station must be maintained, unless the example
of the Platte Fougère land-controlled station becomes
adopted.</p>

<span class="subhead">FLOATING LIGHTHOUSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Hand in hand with the development of the unattended
light for service on land positions has proceeded the adaptation
of the floating light. This may be described briefly
as an enlarged edition of the lighted buoy, which is such
a conspicuous feature of our harbours and estuaries. Yet
it is more than a buoy. It can fulfil all the purposes of a
light-vessel, both as regards the emission of a ray of light
or a distinctive sound, so that both audible and visual
warning are given simultaneously. These lights likewise
are automatic in their action, and, when set going, require
no further attention for some time. Nine months or more
are often permitted to pass without human hands touching
them, and they have solved some very abstruse problems
in connection with coast lighting.</p>

<p>For instance, there is probably no such lonely stretch
of coastline as that of British Columbia and Alaska. There
is only one large port north of Vancouver&mdash;Prince Rupert&mdash;and
this rising hive of maritime activity is 550 miles distant.
The coast is as wild as that of Norway, which, indeed, it
resembles very closely, bristling as it does with fjords and
islands, with rugged cliffs rising abruptly from the water
to a height of several hundred feet. Navigation at night
is extremely hazardous, as the path leads by devious ways
through deep channels intersecting the outer barriers of
islands, where fogs hang low and thickly. The captain
has to pick his way carefully, determining his course by
timing the period between the blast of his siren and its
echo, as it is thrown from headland to headland. As the
passenger traffic developed, the masters of the vessels
entrusted with so many human lives felt the increased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
responsibility keenly, and agitated for more adequate
protection. The erection of lighthouses, even of the most
economical type, would have entailed huge expenditure
by both the United States and Canadian Governments,
while the question of maintenance would have bristled
with searching problems.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it was decided to adopt the floating automatic
system, which had proved eminently satisfactory
in other parts of the world. In this manner a highly
successful and inexpensive solution of the difficulty was
found. These buoys have been installed at all the most
treacherous points leading to sounds and canals, as the
lochs are called, and have been found in every way equal
to the simplest type of attended lighthouse. The southern
coast of Nova Scotia has been protected in a similar manner,
a chain of automatic lights, spaced ten miles apart, having
been completed, so that this wild, rugged shore is patrolled
very efficiently at the present moment. Other countries
have not been dilatory in adopting the same methods.
Consequently, to-day the automatic floating lighthouse is one
of the handiest, most efficient and reliable devices for assisting
navigation that the lighthouse engineer has at his command.</p>

<p>The lights assume different forms, this factor being influenced
by position, specific duty, and local conditions.
Similarly, the character of the illuminant employed also
varies, acetylene, compressed oil-gas, petroleum, and
electricity, being utilized, according to circumstances. On
the whole, however, acetylene gas appears to be the most
favoured illuminating medium, inasmuch as the preparation
of the carbide of calcium has undergone such marked
improvement.</p>

<p>When Mr. Thomas L. Willson discovered the cheap
process for the manufacture of carbide of calcium upon a
commercial scale, and the new industry became placed
upon a firm footing, it was only natural that the inventor
should realize the possibilities of applying the new illuminant
to the assistance of navigation. Acetylene gas
gives a brilliant clear light of intense whiteness, which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
capable of penetrating a great distance. Accordingly, he
set to work to devise a buoy lighted by this gas, and
able to carry sufficient storage of calcium carbide to burn
for weeks or months without attention. When he had
completed the first apparatus of this character, he handed
it over to the Marine Department of the Canadian Government
for submission to any test that they might consider
expedient, in order to ascertain the limits of its application.
The buoy was set in position and watched carefully.
Periodically it was examined to ascertain whether overhauling
and cleaning were necessary, as well as the behaviour
of the light under all conditions of weather. Captains of
vessels passing the beacon were requested to pronounce
their opinions upon the quality of the light, and their remarks
concerning its range, facility with which it might be picked
up, reliability, and so forth, were carefully marshalled and
digested by the authorities. Precisely what the officials
thought of the invention is reflected most convincingly by
the fact that to-day over 300 lights working upon this
principle are stationed in Canadian waters, both upon
the storm-bound ocean coasts and upon the wind-swept
shores of the Great Lakes and waterways.</p>

<div id="ip_286" class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">
  <img src="images/i_p287.jpg" width="445" height="801" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.&mdash;Sectional Elevation of the Willson Automatic
Floating Light.</span> (See <a href="#Page_288">next page</a>.)</div></div>

<p>The Willson buoys are absolutely automatic in their
operation. All the impurities in the gas are removed by
passing it through a special purifier, so that the burner
cannot become clogged or the light impoverished. A charge
of 1,300 to 1,500 pounds of carbide is carried within the
apparatus, and the gas is generated <em>under low pressure</em>.
The lantern is fitted with a Fresnel lens, so that the light
is condensed into an intensely powerful and penetrating
horizontal beam. One prominent feature is that the candle-power
of acetylene gas is seven times as high as that of
compressed oil-gas, while the reservoir of a given size will
contain this equivalent of more light. The candle-power
of these floating lights obviously varies, the largest size
being capable of emitting a beam of 1,000 candle-power,
this flame being the maximum that the lens will stand
without breaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_287">287</a><a  id="Page_288">288</a></span>
The construction and the principle of operation are exceedingly
simple, as may be gathered from reference to
<a href="#ip_286">Fig. 16</a>. The beacon comprises a gas generator tube of
steel (1), which is supported by the steel float chamber (2),
on the upper side of which is placed the support (3) carrying
the lantern (4). Stability is insured by means of the
counterweight (6) attached to the lower end of the generator
tube. A few feet from the bottom of the latter is
a diaphragm (7), fitted centrally with a conically-seated
valve (8) which is mounted on a stem (9). This extends
through the centre of the generator and its head (10).
The upper end of the valve stem carries a hexagonal nut
(11), while the stem itself at this point has a keyway cut
into it. A spline is fitted into the generator head to engage
the keyway, and when the nut (11) is turned to close or
to open the valve, the stem itself cannot move with it,
except in two directions only&mdash;up or down. The nut itself
cannot be turned too far, in which event it might drop
the stem and valve, as there is a stop-collar (12). Leakage
of gas is prevented by a cap (14), which is screwed into
the generator head and sealed with a rubber washer. This
cap is sufficiently long to permit the valve stem to be
raised or lowered so as to adjust the movement of the valve.
The stem of the valve is protected from the carbide by
enclosure within a tube (13), which works through a guide
bar (24) bolted to the side of the generator tube. A grid
(23) is fitted in the centre of the diaphragm (7) and surrounding
the valve (8), so as to prevent small pieces of
carbide, which may pass through the grate (16), from falling
into the water, and thereby being wasted. The steel grate
upon which the carbide rests is attached to the inside of
the generator, a short distance above the diaphragm. The
grid (23) also acts as a valve seat, and is provided with a
rubber packing (15), which is held in a groove in the seat,
and projects a sufficient distance to make a good joint with
the valve (8) when it is closed, even if the valve happen to
be foul.</p>

<p>The carbide of calcium, in the form of large crystals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
measuring about 8 by 4 inches, is placed in the generator
tube when the beacon is immersed in the water, the valve (8)
being opened and the valve-cap (14) screwed down. In
the centre of the counterweight (6) is an orifice through
which the water enters from the outside, and passes through
the open valve, to come into contact with the carbide
resting upon the grate. Gas is generated instantly, to
ascend through the carbide into the purifying chamber (5),
where all deleterious matter is removed, the gas escaping
thence through the small aperture (17) and pipe (18) to
the lantern, to which the supply-pipe is connected by the
aid of the coupling (19).</p>

<p>Of course, at times gas is liable to be generated more
rapidly than it can be consumed. What happens? The
apparatus is not provided with facilities to receive the
surplus gas. Being unable to escape upwards through the
generator tube, it collects at the bottom, and as the pressure
increases it gradually forces the water away from the carbide,
so that generation ceases, and is not resumed until the surplus
gas has been absorbed, when the water once more is able to
come into contact with the carbide. Thus it will be seen
that the gas generation is controlled automatically, and
that it is almost impossible for the gas pressure within
the plant to reach a disruptive degree, owing to the fact
that when it exceeds a certain limit it has a free vent from
the bottom of the device, where the water normally is
permitted to enter to carry out its designed purpose.</p>

<p>This invention has been utilized for a wide variety of
purposes, from the lighting of harbours, navigable channels,
rivers, bays, and so forth, to that of exposed coasts. The
automatic beacon, properly so called, has a tower, which
brings the focal plane to an elevation varying between
50 and 100 feet, this tower being built of lattice steelwork
attached to the top half of the buoy, with a day mark
surrounding the lantern gallery, access to which is secured
by an iron ladder. This type of light carries a sufficient
storage of carbide in a single charge to keep the light burning
continuously for about forty weeks. In this instance the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
only modification from that already described is that the
water for the production of the gas is admitted into the
top instead of to the bottom of the generator. When an
excess of gas occurs, the pressure thereof drives the water
away from the carbide until the surplus has been consumed.
Another type, somewhat smaller, carrying a charge sufficient
for nearly six months, has proved highly successful as a
coastal light, some thirty beacons of this class being
stationed along the shore of British Columbia. The only
trouble experienced therewith in these waters has been due
to frost, which, solidifying the water around the buoy, has
interrupted the designed functions.</p>

<p>But probably the most complete and useful type of
Willson acetylene gas beacon is that in which the Courtenay
whistling device is incorporated, so that in thick weather
audible warning of the danger may be extended. In this
instance the floating chamber which supports the superstructure
carrying the light and also the generator tube,
is fitted with two further tubes which project from the base
like huge legs. These tubes are open at the bottom, but
are closed at the top except for a connection with a valve-casing,
which is fitted with a ball-valve, and upon which
a powerful whistle is bolted. Now, if the buoy is lowered
and anchored in absolutely still water, the water will rise
to the same level within the tubes as it is outside; but when
the buoy is lifted upon the crest of a wave, the level of the
water falls, so that the air space within the tubes is increased.
Air enters this augmented space through the ball-check
inlet valve in the valve-casing. When the beacon falls,
naturally the water endeavours to maintain its level within
the tubes, and therefore the air which was admitted into
the space becomes compressed, to be expelled through
the only possible vent&mdash;the whistle&mdash;thereby producing a
very powerful blast. Thirty of these combined light and
whistling buoys have been strung along the rugged Nova
Scotia coast, and have proved highly popular, that outside
Halifax harbour being known colloquially among seafarers
as the “Outer Automatic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Another acetylene system, but working upon a better
principle, has been perfected in Sweden, and, indeed, now
has been adopted universally, owing to its many excellent
features. This is the “Aga” light, which is the invention
of Mr. Gustaf Dalén,<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> and which has been brought to a high
stage of commercial success by the Gas Accumulator
Company of Stockholm. I have pointed out the one objection
to the Willson acetylene automatic light&mdash;namely,
its uselessness when the surrounding water becomes frozen.
While this drawback does not affect its sphere of utility to
a noticeable degree in Canadian waters, it acts somewhat
adversely in other seas where similar conditions prevail,
but where the navigable channels are kept open by ice-breakers,
such as, for instance, in the Baltic Sea. Mr.
Dalén recognized this weak point in any system wherein
contact with water is responsible for the generation of the
gas, and accordingly sought for a superior method. Fortunately,
the perfection of a new means of handling acetylene,
by French inventors, offered the complete solution of the
problem in a practical way. The principle of this lies in
the use of dissolved acetylene, which is perfectly safe from
explosion, and can be handled with the greatest facility.
The gas can be stored in cylinders similar to those used
for containing oxygen and hydrogen under pressure, gases
which are easier to transport than carbide of calcium, and,
what is far more important, climatic conditions do not
exercise the slightest influence upon it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> The humane labours of Mr. Dalén received recognition by the
award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1912.</p></div>

<p>Dissolved acetylene may be stored within the cylinder,
or accumulator, as it is called, to a pressure of at least
ten atmospheres, and at this pressure it contains 100 times
its own volume of acetylene gas. The accumulators may
be made of any desired size, this factor being governed
by considerations of transport and application, as well as
of the consumption of the burner.</p>

<p>The perfection of the dissolved acetylene process came
as a great boon to the Swedish lighting authorities, inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
as they have probably the most difficult stretch of
coastline in the world to protect. At the same time, owing
to the wild, exposed character of many of the points which
demanded lighting, a perfect, economical, and reliable
automatic system was in urgent demand. Acetylene was
an obvious illuminant, since, while the country is deficient
in the essential resources for the preparation of other fuels,
carbide of calcium is very cheap, Sweden, in fact, being
the largest producer of this commodity. The Swedish
Board of Pilotage experimented with acetylene lighting
for six or seven years, submitting every known acetylene
lighting system to searching practical trials, but failed
to be sufficiently convinced on the vital question of reliability.
Freezing-up was the most pronounced shortcoming,
but when dissolved acetylene appeared as a commercial
product this disadvantage was removed completely,
and acetylene was adopted.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE “KALKGRUNDET,” SWEDEN’S LATEST AUTOMATIC LIGHTSHIP.</p>

<p class="captionc">The Dalén Flasher is used, and this undoubtedly is the finest vessel of its type in the world.</p></div></div>

<p>Yet dissolved acetylene, though completely successful,
possessed one drawback. It was expensive as compared
with oil-gas. Accordingly, there was great scope for a
means of economizing the consumption of the fuel without
interfering with its lighting value and efficiency. At the
same time a superior flashing system was desired. The
methods which were in vogue to this end were satisfactory
so far as they went, but they involved a considerable useless
consumption of gas.</p>

<p>This is where Mr. Gustaf Dalén completed one of his
greatest achievements. He perfected a flashing apparatus
wherein the gas passes to the burner in intermittent puffs,
to be ignited by a small invisible pilot light. The device
was tested and proved so successful that it was adopted
throughout the service. In Swedish waters to-day there
are 127 aids to navigation operating upon this system,
of which five are lightships. The success of the invention
in the land of its origin attracted other nations to its
possibilities. At the present moment over 700 lights,
scattered throughout the world, are working upon this
principle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
If a beacon throws a fixed light, unless it is of extreme
power, it is liable to be confused with a ship’s mast-light,
a fact which was found to be one of the greatest objections
to the fixed white light of the acetylene aid to navigation.
On the other hand, a flashing warning must be of such a
character that it cannot be mistaken for the twinkling of
a brilliant star, or of a light which has nothing to do with
navigation. This is where the “Aga” flasher emphasizes
its value. It throws a short, powerful gleam at brief
intervals. The mariner cannot possibly confuse or misconstrue
it; the regularity of the flash arrests his immediate
attention, and its purport may be divined instantly. The
apparatus is simple and highly effective, while it has the
advantage that the periods of light and darkness can be
altered in relation to one another, or grouped, as desired.</p>

<p>From the maintenance point of view, however, the
invention is of far greater significance. As the gas is
consumed only during the light periods, which are very
brief in comparison with the eclipse, the economy effected
is very appreciable. When the apparatus was first brought
within the range of practical application, many authorities,
which had become wedded to the oil-gas lighting system,
wherein the light flashes are of long duration in comparison
with the dark periods, maintained that the Dalén flash
was too short to be of any value. They disregarded the
fact that the power of the acetylene-gas flash is about seven
times as intense as that of the oil-gas light. For instance,
when the United States acquired the first Aga light in the
autumn of 1908, the authorities demanded either a characteristic
signal comprising ten seconds of light followed by
five seconds of darkness, or flashes and eclipses of equal
duration&mdash;five seconds.</p>

<div id="ip_293" class="figcenter" style="width: 597px;">
  <img src="images/i_p292b.jpg" width="597" height="334" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>THE “SVINBĀDAN,” UNATTENDED LIGHTSHIP IN SWEDISH WATERS.</p>

<p class="captionc">It works upon the Dalén system with flasher, giving a flash of 0·3 second duration, followed by darkness for 2·7 seconds.</p></div></div>

<p>There was a prejudice against short, powerful, and oft-repeating
flashes, mainly because their advantages were
misunderstood. Practical experience, however, demonstrated
the fact that the period of light might be reduced
very considerably, and, as a result of prolonged investigations,
the Swedish Board of Pilotage adopted a characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
comprising 0·3 second light followed by darkness for
2·7 seconds. This has become known since as the “one-tenth
flash,” owing to the luminous interval occupying
one-tenth of the combined period of light and darkness.
It will be seen that, as a result of this arrangement, twenty
flashes are thrown per minute.</p>

<p>As the flame is lighted for only one-tenth of the signal
period, it will be seen that the saving of gas amounts to
90 per cent., as compared with the light which is burning
constantly. Accordingly, the gas charge will last ten times
as long with the flashing apparatus; consequently, the
accumulator need have only one-tenth of the capacity of that
for a similar beacon which burns constantly. The economy
really is not quite 90 per cent., as a certain volume of gas
is consumed by the pilot flame, which ignites the charge of
gas issuing from the flasher burner. This, however, is an
insignificant item, inasmuch as the quantity of gas burned
by the pilot light does not exceed one-third of a cubic foot
per twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Not only has this highly ingenious system been adapted
to varying types of buoys, similar in design and range of
action to those described in connection with the Willson
apparatus, wherein the light may be left unattended for as
long as twelve months, according to the capacity of the
accumulator, but it has also been applied to “light-boats”
and light-vessels. The “light-boat” is a hybrid, being a
combination of the buoy and the lightship, and was devised
to meet special conditions. Thus, the “Gerholmen” light-boat
stationed in the mouth of a Swedish river, where the
current runs exceedingly strongly, resembles a small boat
with a water-tight deck. From the centre of this rises a steel
tripod, at the top of which the lantern is placed. The gas
accumulators are stored within the hull, and are of sufficient
capacity to maintain the light for a round twelvemonth
without attention, as the flashing apparatus is incorporated.</p>

<p>The Aga light has come to be regarded as one of the greatest
developments in lighthouse engineering, and has been adopted
extensively throughout the world in connection with either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
floating or fixed aids to navigation. The United States have
decided to adopt the system exclusively henceforth, until a
further progressive step is achieved, and several floating
lights of this type have been acquired already to guard wild
and lonely stretches of the coastline.</p>

<p>Here and there attempts have been made to apply
electricity to inaccessible lights. The most interesting
endeavour in this direction was in connection with the
lighting of the Gedney Channel from the open Atlantic
to New York harbour. This formerly constituted the only
available highway for the big liners, and it is exceedingly
tortuous and treacherous&mdash;so much so that vessels arriving
off Sandy Hook in waning daylight invariably anchored
and awaited the dawn before resuming the journey. The
great difficulty in connection with Gedney’s Channel was
the distance of the main lights on shore, the direct range
at one part being over thirteen miles. Consequently the
land lights were of little utility to the pilot.</p>

<p>The authorities decided to convert the channel into an
electric-lighted waterway. Buoys were laid down on either
side of the thoroughfare. They were of the spar type,
resembling decapitated masts projecting from the water,
and were held in position by mushroom anchors, weighing
4,000 pounds, or nearly 2 tons, apiece. Each buoy was
crowned with a 100 candle-power incandescent electric
lamp, encased within a special globe having a diameter of
5 inches. An electric cable was laid on either side of this
street and connected with each buoy. The first section
was completed in 1888, the electric gleams being shed for
the first time on November 7 of that year. The system
appeared to give such complete satisfaction that it was
extended. Altogether six and a quarter miles of cable
were laid down, which in itself was no easy feat, while
prodigious difficulties were experienced in its maintenance,
owing to the severity of the currents and the treacherous
character of the sea-bed. The lights were controlled from
a central point ashore, and the idea of being able to switch
on and off a chain of aids to navigation by a simple movement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
presented many attractive features. Although navigation
appreciated this improvement, the Great White
Waterway did not prove a complete success. It did not
possess that vital element of complete reliability which is
so essential to navigation.</p>

<p>Compressed oil-gas has been employed extensively for
unattended floating lights, but it possesses so many shortcomings
that it is being superseded on all sides by acetylene,
with the exception of one or two countries which appear
to be inseparably wedded to this principle. It is expensive
both to install and to maintain, while the “radius of action”&mdash;otherwise,
the period during which it may be left without
human attention&mdash;is unavoidably brief. For temporary
purposes, such as the indication of a submerged wreck, it
is efficient, while it is also serviceable for accessible positions,
but it is not regarded as being a satisfactory system
for places which human hands cannot reach for months at
a time.</p>

<p>Crude petroleum in conjunction with the Wigham long-burning
petroleum lamp, wherein the flame is produced from
a moving wick, has been adopted widely. Lights installed
upon this principle may be left for ninety-three days at a
time without anxiety. In many instances the Wigham light
is mounted upon steel boats; in other cases it is attached
to floating wooden structures. The British Admiralty in
particular is partial to this type of light, and it must be confessed
that it has proved highly serviceable and reliable.</p>

<p>I have described already the general principles and features
of this system. When it is applied to a floating beacon, and
it is desired to save the oil dropping from the drip valve, a
tank is fixed to the deck of the floating structure, and connected
by a flexible pipe to the coupling at the bottom of
the float cylinder. A universal joint is attached to the
connection on the top of the tank to prevent the pipe being
twisted by the swinging and swaying motion of the lamp
on the gimbals. When the lamp is inspected, the oil may
be pumped out of the tank, strained, and used time after
time in the float cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
One of the most interesting of this type of floating boat-lights
is to be seen in Queenstown harbour. The hull is
30 feet in length, and has a beam of 11 feet. On this,
within a conical structure measuring 7½ feet high and 6½ feet
in diameter at the deck, is mounted the lantern. Although
the lamp is exposed to drenching seas and heavy storms,
it has never yet failed, a fact which conclusively points to
its efficiency. It rides well, and the lamp is kept much
drier than the lights on ordinary buoys, according to the
observations of the engineer responsible for its maintenance.
In this case the focus of the light is brought 12 feet above
the level of the sea.</p>

<p>Probably the most compelling illustration of the utility
of the automatic beacon is offered by the unattended lightship.
The Otter Rock vessel is one of the most interesting
examples of this development. It was designed by Messrs.
D. and C. Stevenson, and comprises a substantial steel hull,
the deck of which is covered so that the interior is absolutely
water-tight. The craft is provided with a central and
heavy bilge keels, so as to reduce rolling to the minimum.
Two heavy steel bulkheads divide the craft into three water-tight
compartments, in the centre of which two large welded-steel
gas tanks are stowed. These are of sufficient capacity
to feed the light for several months without replenishment.
The light is mounted upon a steel tower placed amidships,
which brings the focal plane 25 feet above the water. The
gas is fed from the tanks to the lantern through the tower,
a valve reducing the pressure, while a ladder enables the
attendants to climb to the lantern gallery to adjust the
burner and flame, and to clean the lenses, upon the occasion
of their periodical visits.</p>

<p>The gas cylinders are charged from the supply-ship
through flexible hoses, the gas being compressed to about
180 pounds per square inch. The light is of sufficient power
and elevation to be seen from a distance of some twelve
miles. The beacon gives not only a visual, but also an
audible warning. On the deck of the boat a bell is mounted,
this being rung not only by the motion of the ship, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
manner of a bell-buoy, but also by the gas on its passage
from the tanks to the lantern, the bell being fitted with two
clappers for this purpose. The gas in passing from the
tank enters a receptacle having a flexible diaphragm, which,
as it becomes filled with gas, is naturally pressed outwards.
On this is mounted a central metal piece, which is connected
to a rod and lever. As the diaphragm is forced outwards,
it moves the rod and actuates the lever, which, when the
diaphragm falls, return to their normal positions. Attached
to this mechanical arrangement is the bell-clapper, which
alternately is lifted and dropped upon the dome of the bell,
thereby causing it to ring. After the gas has performed its
duty in raising the clapper lever and rod, it passes to the
lantern to be consumed. Thus, while the light gleams
brightly and steadily, the bell rings with unerring regularity&mdash;about
three times per minute&mdash;day and night for months
on a single charge; both must continue in operation until
the supply of gas is expended. The success of this interesting
and novel lightship has been responsible for similar
installations in other similarly wild and exposed positions
where approach is uncertain and often impossible for weeks
at a time.</p>

<p>THE LANTERN USED IN THE WIGHAM AUTOMATIC PETROLEUM BEACON.</p>

<p class="captionl">The circular shallow reservoir contains the burning-oil, which feeds the wick as it moves towards
the burner, and also acts as a deck on which the lantern is built. In this ingenious system the
flame is not produced at the end of the wick as in the ordinary lamp, but from the flat side of the wick,
which is moved continuously in a horizontal direction over a small roller. By this means a light of
uniform intensity is obtained, as carbonization cannot occur.</p></div></div>

<p>One misadventure befell the Otter Rock light-vessel,
which is moored in an open position over the rock of that
name near Islay, although it was not the fault of either the
system or the designing engineers. There was a flaw in one
of the shackles, and while the ship was sawing and tugging
at her anchors during a heavy gale the flaw asserted itself,
the shackle broke, and the lightship got away. She was
recovered with some difficulty, after having drifted about
twenty miles. She was found stove in, having embraced
the rocks during her wayward journey, but otherwise was
unharmed. She was towed into port, repaired, and then
taken back to her station, where she was secured more firmly
than ever, while her chains were closely inspected to make
assurance doubly sure. No repetition of the accident has
occurred since, and the Otter Rock lightship, tethered firmly
to the rock, rides gales and calms, throwing her welcome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
rays and droning her musical warning the whole year round
as steadily and efficiently as if she had a crew aboard.</p>

<p>A similar lightship was built for the Trinity House
authorities from the designs of their engineer, Sir Thomas
Matthews, for service on the English coast. This boat,
built of steel, measures 65 feet in length, by 18½ feet beam
and 10½ feet depth, with the lantern carried at the point of
an open steel pyramidal structure, rising sufficiently high
above the boat’s deck amidships to bring the focal plane
26 feet above the level of the water, thereby giving it a
visible range of some ten miles. The boat is provided with
two holds, in which the gas reservoirs are placed, the total
gas capacity being about 1,500 cubic feet&mdash;enough to keep
the light burning for one hundred days.</p>

<p>This light is of the revolving type, and the rotation of the
apparatus is accomplished very ingeniously. Before the
gas passes to the burner, it drives a tiny three-cylinder
engine, the crank-shaft of which is connected to the revolving
apparatus through gearing. The speed of the turntable is
kept constant by the aid of a governor, and the apparatus
works so smoothly and perfectly that there is not the
slightest divergence from the rate at which the apparatus
is set. As the gas emerges from the engine, it passes to the
burner to be consumed. By means of a novel apparatus,
should anything befall the little motor or the rotating
mechanism, the light does not drop out of service. In
that event the gas flows directly to the burner, the only
difference being that a fixed instead of a revolving light is
emitted.</p>

<p>When the Scandinavian liner <i>Norge</i>, while on her way to
the United States in July, 1904, fouled the terrible Rockall
and lost 750 of her passengers, the outcry about the absence
of all means of indicating this spot to the navigator vibrated
round the world. Yet it was a useless agitation. Rockall
is a no-man’s land; no nation has planted its flag upon its
cone of granite; no Power cares whether it continues its
harvest of human lives or otherwise. The various countries
appear to think that it is too much off the map to be worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
of a moment’s thought; its existence is brought home only
by a holocaust.</p>

<p>After this heartrending disaster, Messrs. D. and C.
Stevenson adumbrated a promising means of indicating
this awful graveyard to the seafarer. They suggested that
two automatic unattended lightships should be constructed,
and that one should relieve the other every six months.
The project was eminently practicable, but every country
seemed to shirk responsibility in the expense of its adoption.
But Rockall is a unique danger spot; in no other
part of the known world does such a formidable isolated
peak of granite rise from the ocean depths, for it is in mid-Atlantic,
160 miles west of St. Kilda, and 290 miles off the
Scottish mainland. It may be away from the great steamship
lanes of the Atlantic, yet a vast volume of shipping
passes within sight of its curious formation. Seeing that
the foremost maritime Powers defray between them the cost
of maintaining the light off Cape Spartel, surely the dictates
of humanity are sufficiently pressing to secure the indication
of this islet. The maintenance of an unattended
automatic beacon, such as Messrs. Stevenson advocated,
would not impose a severe strain upon the treasuries of the
leading Powers of the world, whose interests are associated
intimately with the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>The perfection of the unattended lightship, working automatically,
has provided the lighthouse engineer with a
powerful weapon for marking the most exposed and out-of-the-way
danger spots. When the new development is
carried to its uttermost lengths, no graveyard of the ocean,
no matter how remote and inaccessible, need be without
means of warning shipping of its whereabouts.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LIGHT-KEEPER AND HIS LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The life of the guardian of a blazing signpost of the coast
is much the same the whole world over. It is unavoidably
monotonous under the best conditions. Each succeeding
day and night brings a similar round of toil, with very little
variation. There are the same duties to be performed in
strict accordance with routine, and under normal circumstances
there are many idle hours which have to be whiled
away as best one can. On the mainland, especially in the
South of England, France, Germany, and the United States,
the loneliness and monotony are not felt so keenly by the
wardens of the light, as in many instances they are in close
proximity to ports and towns, where a little welcome relaxation
may be obtained during the rest spells; while in the
summer evenings, if the lights should be only a few miles
away from civilization, visitors are frequent. Again, the
keepers as a rule live with their families in cosy solid buildings,
and, having a stretch of garden flanking their homes,
can expend their hours of leisure to advantage.</p>

<p>On the isolated, lonely rock, however, the conditions are
vastly different. The average person, when regarding on a
calm day the tall slim outlines of a tower rising from the
water, is apt to regard the life of those responsible for keeping
the light going as one enveloped in romance and peace,
far removed from the trials and worries of the maelstrom of
civilization. But twenty-four hours on one of these beacons
completely dispel all romantic impression. The gilt of
fascination wears away quickly, and the visitor recognizes
only too forcibly the terrible desolation of it all, and admires
the little band of men who watch vigilantly over the deep
for the guidance of those who go down to the sea in ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
The keepers of such stations are marooned as completely
as any castaway on a barren island. In many instances
they cannot even signal to the shore. If anything should go
wrong, they must wait until a ship comes in sight, to communicate
their tidings by flag signals. If the call is urgent,
say for illness, and the passing boat carries a doctor, she will
heave to, and, if conditions permit, will launch a boat to
carry the medical man to the rock to administer aid. If it
is a matter of life or death, the ship will take the man off.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, upon a sea-rock, owing to the
slender proportions of the tower, the quarters are inevitably
very cramped, with no facilities for the men to stretch their
limbs. The manner in which space is economized in the
small circular apartments is astonishing. The essential
furniture is built to the wall, and liberal cupboard space is
provided, the governing consideration being to provide the
men with as much open space as the restricted circumstances
will permit. The only exercise that the men can obtain in
the open air is upon the narrow shelf forming the landing
platform, or the narrow gallery around the lantern. In the
majority of circumstances it is less than that provided for
the benefit of a prisoner in an exercise yard.</p>

<p>The lamp is lighted at dusk, and, unless it is a fixed white
light, the clockwork driving the occulting and revolving
mechanism has to be wound up. Seeing that this entails the
lifting of a ton or so up the vertical cylinder in which the
weight travels, this is no mean task in itself.</p>

<p>Unremitting vigilance has to be maintained while the
lamp is burning. It demands attention from time to time,
while, should anything serious go wrong, the attendant must
bring the reserve lamp into service without a moment’s loss
of time and without interruption of the ray.</p>

<p>“The light must not go out!” That is the inflexible rule
of all attended lights between the two Poles. Even if it
failed only for a minute, the circumstance would not escape
observation. Some vessel would detect the breakdown; it
would be recorded in the captain’s log-book. When he
touched the first port, intimation would be sent to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
organization responsible for the beacon, setting forth the
fact that on such and such a night, at a certain hour, this
light was not showing in accordance with the official light
list, or was giving a warning different from that laid down
for the guidance of the seafarer. An inquiry would be
instituted immediately to ascertain the reason, and the
light-keeper probably would find himself in an awkward
position, although months might have elapsed since the
incident.</p>

<p>There is nothing haphazard about the control of lights.
The circumstances are too serious to permit the slightest
deviation from hard-and-fast regulations. The passing
mariner is entirely dependent upon these blazing guardians,
maybe from a distance of fifteen miles or more. He has his
chart wherewith he is able to steer his way, but he must
have certain marks to guide him at night, so that he may be
sure of his course and position. Accordingly, every lighthouse
possesses some individual characteristic in regard to
its light. As explained elsewhere, it may be a group flash,
an occulting flash of a distinctive nature, a revolving light
which completes a revolution once in a certain period of
time, or a fixed blaze.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the men watching over the lights appreciate
the gravity of their responsibility, and are reliable to an
heroic degree. Each is a man picked for the duty, who is
not appalled by loneliness, and is of unimpeachable precision.
Of course, accidents will happen, but dereliction of
duty is criminal, because it may bring about loss of life.
Carelessness on the part of a light-keeper precipitated the
loss of the steamer <i>Victoria</i> when crossing the English
Channel from Newhaven to Dieppe on April 12, 1887. The
French coast, as it was being approached, became shrouded
by the inexorable fog-fiend. The captain lost his way,
although he knew, from the time he had been steaming, that
he must be perilously near the French shore. He listened
for the droning of the fog-siren mounted on Pointe d’Ailly,
but in vain. He sent to the engine-room to ascertain
the number of revolutions the engines had made, and this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
convinced him that he must be close inshore, despite the
silence of the fog-signal. Thinking that he might have
strayed some distance east of Dieppe, he brought his vessel
round, and then crawled slowly ahead. But he had scarcely
settled into his forward stride when there was a crash&mdash;a
terrible splitting and crunching. The vessel had kept a
true course, and now had hit the very rocks which the captain
had sought to avoid. The passengers, being ready to land,
were got into the boats and pushed through the dense curtain
for land, but some thirty passengers and crew were never
seen again.</p>

<p>The subsequent inquiry revealed an amazing breach of
duty on the part of those in charge of the light-station. The
head lighthouse-keeper, off duty at the time, was asleep in
bed, but his wife awoke him as she observed the fog settling
upon the water. He dressed hurriedly, and rushed to see
what his companion was doing. This official had failed
lamentably in his duties. Instead of starting the boiler
fires to raise the steam to work the siren upon the first signs
of the approaching enemy, as he should have done, he had
delayed the duty. The result was that an hour was wasted,
and during this interval the unfortunate captain took his
ship upon the rocks. To make matters worse, the keepers
did not perceive the wreck until some two hours after the
disaster, although they admitted that they heard the cries
of people an hour and a half previously, but never suspected
the cause of the turmoil.</p>

<p>The man on watch during the night maintains a keen
lookout. The faintest signs of a gathering mist are sufficient
to cause him to wake his assistant to manipulate the
fog-signal, even if the precaution proves to be unnecessary.
“It is better to be safe than sorry,” is the lighthouse-keeper’s
motto; so he runs no risks.</p>

<p>When the gathering brightness of the dawn enables the
form of the tower to be identified from a distance of several
miles, the light is extinguished. Heavy curtains are drawn
across the windows, not only to protect the lenses from the
sun, but also to give a characteristic colour to the lantern.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Thus, by daylight a lantern may appear to be a dull red or
an intense black. To give a brilliant light by night and be
a prominent landmark by day forms the dual duty of the
guardian of the coast.</p>

<p>When the lantern has cooled, the keepers coming on the
day shift have to clean the lamps and put them in order
for service the following evening. Everything has to be
overhauled and got ready for use at a moment’s notice.
The oil reservoirs have to be examined and charged, and the
panes of glass, with which the lantern is glazed, cleaned and
brightened. The reflectors have to be polished, for they
must be kept in a constant state of mirror-like brilliancy.
All brasswork has to be cleaned and polished until it gleams
like burnished gold, while the rooms must be washed and
kept in the pink of condition, free from the smallest specks
of dust.</p>

<p>The necessity for extreme cleanliness and spotlessness is
emphasized in every lighthouse. The inspector has a highly-trained,
quick eye for detecting carelessness, and he has one
instinct developed peculiarly&mdash;the discovery of dust. He
draws his fingers over everything, and squints quizzically at
an object from all angles. Woe betide the keeper if the
slightest trace of dirt is detected. Then the inspector
closes the other eye, and the keeper receives a squint which
does not augur well for his future. A few sharp, pointed
remarks are rasped out, and it is not long before the relief-boat
comes out with another man.</p>

<p>The engineers and other representatives of authority are
remorseless. A man is judged from apparently trifling
details. If he permits a door-knob to become sullied, he is
just as likely to overlook the polishing of the lenses, or to
perform some other vital task in a perfunctory manner.</p>

<p>One of the Stevensons achieved a peculiar notoriety among
the Scottish keepers for his unbending attitude in this connection.
He had a scent for dust and untidiness developed
as keenly as that of a mouse for cheese. When his boat
came alongside a light, and the keeper stepped forward to
extend a helping hand, the eyes of the engineer scanned him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
searchingly. If the man’s appearance were not immaculate,
trouble loomed ahead. This engineer maintained that if a
man were indifferent to his own appearance, and permitted
dust to collect upon his own clothes, he could not be trusted
to maintain the delicate apparatus of a lighthouse in apple-pie
order! What was more to the point, the engineer generally
was correct in his deductions. He spared no effort to
place the most responsible lights in the hands of men above
suspicion in regard to cleanliness. Although, as this
martinet confessed, nothing pained him more than to have
words with any of his keepers, cleanliness had to be maintained.</p>

TO THE LANTERN-ROOM.</p></div></div>

<p>When the keeper has completed his routine duties, he is
at liberty to spend his leisure according to his inclinations.
As a rule the men turn these periods to advantage. Reading
is a popular recreation, and the authorities maintain a circulating
library, the books being changed with every relief.
But the men could accept twice as much literature as is
available at present. Here a word should be said concerning
the Lighthouse Literature Mission and its work, which is
international. The idea was conceived by Mr. Samuel H.
Strain, and the work is conducted from Belfast, Ireland.
The most conspicuous feature of this organization is that
every penny received is turned to good and useful purpose
in connection with the object. The founder conducts it
without monetary reward, so that the item of “operating”
charges does not swamp the greater proportion of receipts,
as is the case with so many so-called missions in other fields.
There are few organizations which are so deserving of
financial support, because this mission brings welcome relaxation
to a hard-worked community whose vigil secures the
safety of those who travel on the sea. The labours of Mr.
Strain are highly appreciated by those who keep watch and
ward in seagirt prisons, and the mission deserves far
stauncher support from the philanthropic than it receives
at present. Sympathizers with the loneliness of the lighthouse-keeper
are prone to think that these men are in dire
need of spiritual pabulum, and are apt to send literature of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
an emphatic goody-goody nature. But the keeper of the
light is as human as the clerk in the city. He is so accustomed
to the company of Nature, and has cultivated such
a deep respect for the Master of the Universe during his
spells of duty, that he welcomes a diversion therefrom in his
hours of leisure. A humorous paper is more welcome than
a tract on the evils of drink.</p>

<p>When the weather is favourable the men seek a little
relaxation in fishing, but here again they have to suffer
considerable denial, as the tackle invariably becomes inextricably
entangled with the rocks, so that the losses exceed
the prizes. In the United States the greater number of
the keepers maintain a garden well stocked with vegetables
and flowers. The tending of these charges carries the minds
of the men from their work completely, and for the opportunity
to practise this hobby they are indebted to the kindness
of the Government, which supplies seeds free of charge.</p>

<p>It is when the gale is raging tumultuously that the men
in the tower are compelled to realize their position. The
waves pound the rock and building so ceaselessly and
relentlessly that the latter trembles and shakes like a leaf.
At times the din is so deafening that the men cannot converse;
they are compelled to communicate with each other
by signs. The waves pick up stones and hurl them with
terrific force against the lantern. Occasionally the elements
triumph in their assault, and the missiles shatter the glass.
To step out on the gallery in the teeth of a blizzard to clear
the snow away demands no little courage. As the man
emerges upon the narrow platform, he is engulfed in the
swirling flakes, and often is pinned against the masonry so
tightly by the wind that he cannot move a limb; at other
times he is swept almost off his feet. While engaged in his
freezing task, he also runs the risk of being drenched by a

<p>COMBINED KITCHEN AND LIVING-ROOM IN THE LIGHTHOUSE.</p></div></div>

<p>The men on the lonely, exposed Tillamook Rock, off the
Oregon coast, have had more than one occasion to respect
the storm-fiend. One night, while a fearful gale was raging,
a huge mass of rock was torn away from the islet, snatched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
by the waves, and thrown high into the air. It fell with
terrific force upon the dome of the lantern, splintering the
roof and smashing the light, so that no welcome rays could
be thrown from the tower again that night. The keepers
at once set to work with the fog-signal, and during the hours
of darkness worked like slaves, blaring out a warning by
sound which they were unable to give visually.</p>

<p>Fortunately, such an experience as befell the keepers
of the American Thimble Shoal light is very rare. This
beacon marks the shoal of that name, and is, or rather was,
a screw-pile iron lighthouse, marking 11 feet of water at the
entrance to Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, U.S.A. On December
27, 1909, the keepers were immersed in their tasks, when
there was a terrible crash followed by a dismal rending and
splitting. The building shivered from top to bottom. The
keepers were thrown off their feet, and when they regained
their wits they found that the schooner <i>Malcolm Baxter
Junior</i>, while being towed by a tug, had blundered into
them, and had carried a considerable portion of the building
away. The impact upset the light; the scattered oil burst
into flame, and within a few minutes the lighthouse was
blazing like a gigantic bonfire. The keepers stuck to their
posts, and endeavoured frantically to extinguish the outbreak,
but their efforts were too puny to make any impression.
At last, when a foothold was no longer possible with
safety, and under extreme pressure, they abandoned their
charge. When the flames had completed their destructive
work the lighthouse presented a sorry sight, being a mass of
broken and twisted ironwork. A wooden tower was erected
with all despatch, and a fog-signal was installed, so that
the men could carry on their duties while the reconstruction
of the station was hurried forward.</p>

<p>The keepers turn their hands to strange occupations.
Fretwork, wood-carving, poker-work, and similar hobbies,
are practised freely. A few devote their leisure to intellectual
improvement to fit them for other walks in life.
The keeper of Windward Point, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
devoted his energies to studying, and obtaining diplomas in,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
mechano-therapy and suggestive therapeutics, as well as
becoming proficient in Esperanto. The keepers of two
other American lights set themselves to the mastery of
jurisprudence, and in due course resigned their positions
and rented offices in the city, where in the course of a few
years they built up very remunerative legal practices. As
a rule the lighthouse-keeper is an expert handy-man, as he
is compelled to complete a whole list of duties in addition
to maintaining the lights. In the summer the metal and
wooden lights have to be given a coat of paint, while plumbing
and other displays of skill in metal have to be carried
out, even if only temporarily.</p>

<p>The calling is exceedingly healthy, which accounts for the
immunity from illness which these men enjoy. Also, as a
rule, the land-lights are set amidst wild romantic surroundings.
Some years ago a number of American families, in
the search for a quiet, health-restoring rest, were in the habit
of spending their vacations at lighthouses, to the financial
profit of the keepers. Eventually, however, the authorities,
fearing that the keeper might be distracted from his duties,
issued a summary order forbidding this practice, much to
the disgust of the men, and “attractive lighthouse apartments”
became a thing of the past. In Great Britain an
order was issued that “no ale or other intoxicating liquor
be allowed to be sold in any lighthouse.” The precise
reason for this strange ordinance is not quite clear, but it
is significant to note that it came into force immediately
after the disastrous fire at the Leasowe lighthouse, on the
Wirral shore.</p>

<p>The lighthouse invariably is an object of attraction among
the general public, but this interest seldom goes to the
length narrated by a keeper of one of the West Indian
lights. One night two of the men at this particular station
decided to hunt for red crabs on the beach below. They
started off with a hurricane lamp, but were astonished, when
they gained the foreshore, to see a large sloop hard and fast
on the reef, although the night was beautifully clear and the
light was burning brilliantly. With much effort the keepers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
got out their dory, put off to the wreck, and endeavoured
to get the sloop out of her uncomfortable position, but,
finding her too well fixed, took off the passengers. The
survivors were housed in the keepers’ quarters until next
morning, when they were succoured. The head-keeper
asked the captain how he managed to get into such a position,
and to his surprise learned that, as the passengers were
anxious to obtain a clear close view of the light, the master
had stood inshore, not knowing that the reef over which
vigil was mounted ran out far into the water. That navigator
paid dearly for his attempt to satisfy curiosity. His
sloop broke up, since she was impaled too firmly to be
salvaged.</p>

<p>It is not often that the utter loneliness and monotony of
the daily round unhinges a keeper’s mind, but this awful
fate overtook the warden of a somewhat isolated American
light. The man had served with Admiral Dewey off Manila,
and upon his return home the Government placed him in
charge of a station as an occupation for the evening of his
life, and as a recompense for faithful service. He settled
down with his wife and family, but the isolation soon began
to affect his brain. For days he would absent himself from
the light, which would soon have failed had it not been for
the unswerving devotion of his wife and the assistance of
one of two friends living in the locality. They spared no
effort to keep the beacon burning, lest the authorities might
hear about the keeper’s strange behaviour, and deprive
him of his charge, and, incidentally, of his livelihood. In
due course the incident did reach the authorities, and, not
knowing what was the matter with the man, they took
action accordingly. As the keeper entered the station after
one of his inexplicable expeditions of a fortnight’s duration,
he was arrested for desertion. He was examined promptly
by two doctors, who found him hopelessly insane, and was
incarcerated in an asylum, where in the course of a few days
he became a raving lunatic.</p>

<p>Often the keepers, although only condemned to imprisonment
for a certain period at a time, have to tolerate a longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
stay, owing to the relief-boat being unable to approach them.
In some instances the delay may run into five weeks or
more. During the winter the relief of the Eddystone, Longships,
Wolf, Fastnet, Skerryvore, and Dhu-Heartach lights
is always a matter of extreme uncertainty. Although the
men have to provide themselves with supplies, a reserve is
maintained at the station by the authorities for such emergencies.
Even some of the land stations are not approachable
readily. There is the Punta Gorda light-station on
the Californian coast, the situation of which is wild and forbidding.
There is a landing about eight miles above the
station, but it is extremely precarious. Still, unless a certain
element of risk is accepted in coming ashore here, it is
necessary to face a tramp or stage journey of nearly fifty
miles across country in order to gain the lighthouse.</p>

<p>The lighthouses in the Red Sea are, perhaps, among the
most unenviable and trying in the world. This stretch of
water, lying between two blistered coasts of sand, is no more
or less than an oven, where even the strongest constitution
finds it difficult to hold out for long. Moreover, the absence
of civilization, owing to the extreme aridity of the country,
renders the life exceptionally depressing. In the summer
the heat is wellnigh intolerable. The thermometer hovers
between 95° and 110° F. in the shade throughout the twenty-four
hours, so that night brings no relief to the oppressiveness.</p>

<p>At some of the stations the men seek a little diversion,
and incidentally add occasionally to their pocket-money,
by shark-catching, which is a tolerably profitable pursuit,
since these waters are thickly infested with this fish. The
jawbone and backbone invariably find ready purchasers,
the former being mounted as a curiosity, while the backbone
forms a novel and serviceable walking-stick.</p>

<p>One method of trapping these monsters which affords
keen delight was related to me. The requirements are an
electric battery, some rope, a few feet of electric wire, a
cartridge, and an empty box, with a chunk or two of bad
meat. The cartridge is fitted with an electric primer, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
wire of which stretches to the battery. This cartridge is
buried in a hunk of meat, the whole being dangled from a
box&mdash;an empty cask is better&mdash;which serves as a float,
while a rope is stretched from the box to the shore, with the
electric wire spirally wound round it. A short length of
chain is preferable, if available, to attach the bait to the
float, but a short piece of rope will do. This novel line is
thrown into the water, and the man keeps his eye on the
float, with one finger on the battery. The hungry shark,
espying the tempting morsel, makes a grab and swallows
it, but the chain prevents him tearing away with it. The
pull causes the float to disappear, the man’s finger presses
the button, and the trick is done. There is an explosion,
and pieces of shark and showers of water fly into the air.
The incident is all over too quickly for the fish to marvel
about the strange indigestibility of the tainted meat he
grabbed so greedily. The men enjoy this sport hugely when
it can be followed, as they regard the shark with intense
detestation.</p>

<p>KEEPER CLEANING THE LAMP AFTER IT HAS COOLED DOWN.</p></div></div>

<p>Despite the vigilance of the various Powers, slave-running
is still a lucrative business on these forbidding coasts. Now
and again a forced labourer gets away from his taskmaster,
and comes panting into the lighthouse territory. This is
sanctuary to the hapless wretch, and although the keepers
invariably receive a call from the runaway’s master, he
meets with scant courtesy, while his demand for the surrender
of the fugitive is answered by a point-blank refusal.
The slave-driver may storm, threaten, and abuse, to his
heart’s content, and, as he is generally a past-master in
Arabian invective, the keepers have to listen to a pretty
tune. But the slave is kept in the lighthouse until the
relief-tender makes its periodical call, when he is taken back
to Suez and liberated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, owing to the extreme care that is manifested
by the authorities, mishaps at a lighthouse are few and far
between. The men are supplied with rules and regulations
which are drawn up with an eye for every possible emergency.
Yet accidents will happen, due in the majority of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
instances to familiarity bred of contempt. The majority
of these calamities occur in connection with the explosive
fog-signalling apparatus, although every device is adopted
to safeguard the men. At one of the Scottish stations a
keeper was manipulating the fog-signal, but, flying in the
face of instructions, he caused the charge to explode prematurely.
The man escaped injury, but the detonation
shattered several panes of glass in the lantern.</p>

<p>One of the keepers of the Rathlin light, on Altacarry
Head, was not so fortunate. The White Star Canadian
liner <i>Megantic</i> was rounding the corner of Ireland to enter
the last lap of the homeward journey one Saturday evening,
when the captain’s attention was arrested by a signal of
distress flying from the lighthouse. The interpretation of
the signal revealed the fact that a doctor was wanted, so,
easing up the ship, he lowered a boat, and the doctor was
sent away to the island. Upon landing he found one of the
men in dire straits. He had been cleaning the fog-gun,
when a charge, which had been left in the weapon inadvertently
upon the last occasion it was used, exploded.
The man’s arm had been wrenched off, and he was burned
terribly. It was a stroke of luck that the liner hove in
sight at the moment she did. There was no chance of extending
succour to the injured man on the spot, and he would
have died before a doctor could have been summoned by
boat from Ballycastle, nine miles away. The surgeon
bound up the man’s injuries, lowered him into his boat, and,
on regaining the liner, placed him in the hospital, where he
was tended until the vessel’s arrival in Liverpool, where he
was landed and placed in hospital.</p>

<p>More remarkable was the accident which happened at
the Flannen Islands light-station in 1900; it remains an
unsolved mystery to this day. This is one of Scotland’s
lonely lights, mounting guard over a group of islets fifteen
miles off the Hebrides. On December 26 the relief-tender
approached the station on her usual fortnightly visit, but, to
the amazement of those on board, no signs of the keepers or
the usual signals were to be seen, while the lantern was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
dressed in its daylight garb. The crew landed hurriedly,
wondering what was amiss. They found the lighthouse
absolutely deserted; not a sign of any of the three keepers
was to be seen or heard. They examined the log, and found
that the light had not been burning for some days, the last
entry being made about 4 a.m. nearly a week previously.
The rock was searched, but yielded no clue to the mystery
of the complete disappearance of the men. The light had not
been abandoned; it had simply burned itself out. It was a
fortunate circumstance that very little shipping frequents
these seas during the winter, or there would have been one
or two marine disasters, as the islands are often wrapped
in fog.</p>

<p>It is surmised that one of the men ventured outside on to
a rocky ledge in the early hours of the morning. According
to the log, a vicious storm was raging at the time, and probably
in the darkness the man was swept off his feet and
carried into the sea. The second keeper on duty, marvelling
at the non-return of his assistant, evidently had roused
his other companion, and the two had instituted a search in
the storm, only in turn to be caught by a wave and carried
away.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, since 1860, men only have been employed
by the Trinity House Brethren for the maintenance
of the lights, but in the United States women still are engaged
in this duty. Some of the British lights have been
controlled by one family through two or three generations.
It was only a few years ago that a Darling retired from the
vigil on the Longstones of Farne Islands, the scene of Grace
Darling’s heroism, while for a century and a half one family
kept the South Foreland light faithfully. The Casquets
light off Alderney, in the Channel Islands, was maintained
by one family, some of the children spending the whole of
their lives on the rock, son succeeding father at the post of
duty.</p>

<p>On the American coast, however, women are more extensively
employed. Seeing that many of the lights are burned
in a low tower projecting from the dwelling-house, this circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
may be readily understood, as the duties beyond
the maintenance of the light are not exacting. One of the
most notable instances, however, is the Point Pino light at
the entrance to Monterey Bay, on the Californian coast, the
guardianship of which has been in feminine hands for the
past thirty years. For something approaching half a century
a woman maintained the Michigan City harbour light
on the Great Lake of that name. Indeed, the associations
were so deep-rooted and long that the beacon became
popularly known as “Miss Colfax’s light,” after the name
of its keeper. Even when she attained the age of eighty
years she was as active and attentive to her charge as on
the day, in 1861, when she first assumed responsibility for
its safe-keeping.</p>

<p>In those times there was a beacon established on the end
of the wooden pier, which railed off an area of the restless
lake for the purposes of the inland port. Those were strenuous
days. Her home was on shore, and every night and
morning she tramped the long arm of woodwork to light and
extinguish the lamp. Lard-oil was used, and during the
winter the food for the lamp had to be heated to bring it
into a fluid condition before she set out from home. It was
no easy matter struggling along on a blusterous, gusty
evening, with a pail of hot oil in one hand and a lamp in the
other, over a narrow plank. Often, when a gale was raging,
progress was so slow that by the time the beacon was
reached the oil had cooled and congealed, rendering it a
difficult matter to induce the lamp to burn. Once set going,
however, it was safe for the night, as the heat radiated from
the burner kept the lard melted. In addition to this lamp,
there was another light in the tower projecting from the
roof of her house, which had to be maintained, and this,
being the main light, was the more important of the two.</p>

<p>In 1886 the pier tower was taken out of her hands for
ever. A furious gale, such as is peculiar to these inland seas,
and which cannot be rivalled on the ocean for fury, was
raging. At dusk she started on her usual journey. Time
after time she was wellnigh swept off her feet, so that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
staggered rather than walked, for the spray and sand flecking
her face nearly blinded her. When she gained the tower
she paused, and observed that it was trembling violently.
Undismayed, she ascended, lit the light, and tramped back
to the shore. Scarcely had she gained the mainland, when,
glancing seawards, she saw the light sway from side to side
for a second or two, and then make a dive into the water. A
few moments later a crash reverberated above the noise of
the storm: the decrepit pier had succumbed at last. Hers
was a lucky escape, but she hurried home, and sat by the
main light gleaming from her roof all that night, apprehensive
that some vessel might endeavour to make the harbour and
come to grief. When the pier was rebuilt, a new beacon was
placed on its extremity, but its upkeep was taken over by
the harbour authorities, leaving only the shore light in the
trusty woman’s keeping, the wicks of which for over forty
years were trimmed and lit at dusk, and extinguished with
the dawn, with her own hands.</p>

<p>During the migratory season of the birds extraordinary
sights are witnessed around the light at night. The brilliant
glare attracts enormous flocks, which flit to and fro. As
the monster flaming spoke swings round, the birds, evidently
blinded by the glare, dash with such fury against the glass
panes of the lantern as to flutter to the floor of the gallery
with broken necks and wings, while large numbers, dazed or
killed, fall into the water. The birds are of all species, and
at times may be picked up by the basketful. Then the
light-keepers are able to secure a welcome change in their
dietary. Moths, too, often hover in clouds round the light,
and are of such variety that an hour on the gallery would
bring infinite delight and rich harvests to the youthful entomologist
who has to be content to hunt around electric lamps
in quiet streets at night.</p>

<p>While the lamp is burning, time cannot drag, owing to the
multitude of details which compel the keeper’s constant
attention. The official log has to be kept posted with a host
of facts, such as temperature, barometric readings, weather
conditions as they vary from hour to hour, behaviour of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
lamps, etc.; while, when the lighthouse is a marine signal-station
as well, passing ships have to be signalled and
reported. The spell of labour varies from four to five hours
or more. Obviously, the task is more exacting and arduous
in the winter than in summer. During the former season the
lamps have to be lighted as early as 3.15 p.m., and are not
extinguished until eight o’clock the next morning. In the
summer, on the other hand, the lamps may be required for
less than six hours or so. In northern latitudes where the
daylight is continuous owing to the midnight sun, the light
scarcely seems necessary. Yet it is kept burning during the
scheduled hours of darkness.</p>

<p>Thus, night in and night out the whole year round, a
comparatively small band of faithful toilers keeps alert vigil
over the dangers of the deep, for the benefit of those who
“go down to the sea in ships, and do their business in great
waters.” The safety of thousands of human lives and of
millions sterling of merchandise is vested in their keeping.
The resources of the shipbuilder, the staunchness of the
ship, the skill and knowledge of the captain&mdash;all would count
for nothing were it not for the persistent, steady glare of the
fixed, the twinkling of the occulting, or the rhythmic,
monotonous turning spokes of the revolving light, thrown
over the waste of waters from the lighthouse and the
lightship.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
